  <!-- Application styles. The instructions below will be processed
       by 'grunt processhtml' command. They are equivalent to a build
       instructions inside html
       
       I'm thinking that our convention could be to have one css
       file per application (this css can be built automatically,
       by concatenating side-wide css and app specific). On the other
       hand, we can also use imports inside css, which seems much
       cleaner. And transparent

       it point to the file that will be loaded by require.js; 
       the suffix '.js' is added by require.js automatically
