        "abstract": "We present near-infrared observations of the counterpart of GRB 000301C. The K' filter (2.1 μm) light curve shows a well-sampled break in the decay slope at t~3.5 days postburst. The early time slope is very shallow (~-0.1), while the late time slope is steep (-2.2). Comparison with the optical (R-band) light curve shows marginally significant differences, especially in the early time decay slope (which is steeper in the optical) and the break time (which occurs later in the optical). This is contrary to the general expectation that light-curve breaks should either be achromatic (e.g., for breaks due to collimation effects) or should occur later at longer wavelengths (for most other breaks). The observed color variations might be intrinsic to the afterglow, or might indicate systematic errors of 〉~0.08 mag in all fluxes. Even if the break is achromatic, we argue that its sharpness poses difficulties for explanations that depend on collimated ejecta. The R light curve shows further signs of fairly rapid variability (a bump, steep drop, and plateau) that are not apparent in the K' light curve. In addition, by combining the IR-optical-UV data with millimeter and radio fluxes, we are able to constrain the locations of the self-absorption break and cooling break and to infer the location of the spectral peak at t=3 days, f<SUB>ν</SUB>~3.4 mJy at ν~10<SUP>12</SUP> Hz. Using the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution, we are able to constrain the blast wave energy, which was E〉~3×10<SUP>53</SUP> ergs if the explosion was isotropic. This implies a maximum gamma-ray production efficiency of ~0.15 for GRB 000301C.",

        "body": "1. INTRODUCTION Infrared observations can be used to improve our understanding of gamma‐ray burst afterglows in several ways. First, they can be combined with optical measurements to obtain spectral slope measurements with a much wider wavelength baseline, and hence yield a more accurate spectral slope than optical data alone. Second, they can be used to test observed light‐curve breaks for wavelength dependence, which is an important discriminant between breaks due to ejecta collimation and other possible causes. Finally, it has been suggested that bursts are preferentially located in dusty regions, e.g., under “hypernova” scenarios in which bursters are a final evolutionary stage of some class of massive stars. If so, and if the dusty region extends beyond the expected dust destruction distance (Waxman Draine 2000), then near‐infrared observations will detect some afterglows that are obscured at optical wavelengths. At less extreme dust optical depths, near‐infrared data help us to characterize the host galaxy extinction and so thereby infer both extinction‐corrected fluxes and properties of dust and gas in high‐redshift GRB host galaxies. We present here near‐infrared (NIR) photometric observations of the afterglow of the gamma‐ray burst GRB 000301C. These constitute the best‐sampled near‐infrared light curve for any afterglow to date. GRB 000301C was detected independently by the All‐Sky Monitor on the Rossi X‐Ray Timing Explorer and by two spacecraft (Ulysses and NEAR) of the current Interplanetary Network on 2000 March 1.4108 UT. The event was a single‐peaked GRB lasting approximately 10 s (Smith, Hurley, Cline 2000) at low energies (10 keV) and 2 s at higher energies (>25 keV) (Jensen et al. 2000). Coordinates were available approximately 36 hours after the burst, and an optical counterpart was reported by Fynbo et al. (2000) based on observations at March 3.21 UT. The redshift of the burst was first reported as Smette et al. 2000a) and subsequently refined to Smette et al. 2000b) using the observed Lyman break in a near‐UV spectrum of the GRB afterglow. Weak metal lines in absorption yielded further improvements to Castro et al. 2000) or Jensen et al. 2000). 2. PHOTOMETRIC DATA 2.1. Infrared Telescope Facility Images We present data obtained at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea as part of a service mode Target of Opportunity program for broadband near‐IR follow‐up of gamma‐ray bursts using the NSFCam imager. Observing conditions were good throughout the period, with clear skies and subarcsecond seeing on all nights. All data were taken with a plate scale of 0Table 1. TABLE 1 Log of the IRTF Data UT Date t Filter Exposure(s) Number ofFrames Seeing Magnitude Error Photometric Total 4.652... 3.241 J 700 14 0 19.11 0.05 0.064 4.640... 3.229 K′ 672 14 0 17.66 0.04 0.057 5.610... 4.199 K′ 672 14 0 18.01 0.05 0.064 6.595... 5.184 K′ 435 9 0 18.57 0.12 0.126 8.590... 7.179 K′ 1400 28 0 19.29 0.09 0.098 Observed time elapsed since the GRB is represented by t . “Exposure” is the sum of the exposure times for all GRB images in that filter and night. The “photometric” error is due to Poisson statistics of received photons. The “total” error combines the photometric error in quadrature with an estimated 0.04 mag error due to sky subtraction and flat‐fielding uncertainties. We reduced and analyzed the data following standard near‐IR procedures. Raw sky flats were generated for each filter and night using the mean of all available frames after outlier rejection to eliminate the influence of objects on the flat field. Final flats were generated by subtracting stacked dark frames (taken with the same exposure time, number of co‐adds, and number of nondestructive reads as the data) from the raw flats and normalizing the result to have mea We measured the GRB fluxes on all nights using aperture photometry with an aperture diameter of 1 south of the optical transient. (This is star A of Garnavich et al. 2000a.) The J‐ and K′‐ band magnitudes of this star were Casali Hawarden 1992) taken immediately before the first IRTF observations of GRB 000301C. The reference magnitudes used for FS 27 were Wainscoat Cowie 1992) and Our counts always remained below the nominal linearity limit for NSFCam (Leggett Denault 1996); we therefore did not apply nonlinearity corrections to our data. We placed the J‐band data on the CIT magnitude system using J −K), where JMK is the natural magnitude system for the current Mauna Kea J filter in NSFCam. This gives K′ magnitudes were left on the NSFCam instrumental system. Errors due to photon counting statistics were computed based on an iteratively clipped variance of each night’s final stacked images, suitably corrected for the correlated noise introduced by bilinear interpolation. Sky subtraction errors arise only from the difference between sky level in the photometry aperture and in the sky annulus. These errors are separated into statistical errors (due to photon noise in the sky annulus) and systematic (due to objects in the sky annulus or any other source of bias in estimating the true background under the transient source). The statistical part is always small compared to statistical errors from the object flux measurement, due to the large number of pixels in the sky annulus (∼900) and much smaller number (∼28) in the photometric aperture. Systematic errors in sky subtraction are potentially larger, but we believe they are under reasonable control in our data set because the sky level was removed in two steps (globally, during data reduction, and locally, during aperture photometry) accounting for up to first order gradients in both time and space; and because the weather was cooperative, with relatively little temporal variation in sky background (10% minimum to maximum in any night and filter, and usually less) and subarcsecond seeing (allowing small photometry apertures). Further possible error sources include centroiding of the afterglow and reference star (expected to be systematic‐error limited at the 0.1 pixel level) and residual flat‐fielding difficulties. Neither will be large compared to our photon counting noise. To be conservative, we estimate that sky subtraction and flat‐fielding errors combined may affect all of our photometry at up to the 4% level. Table 1 lists both pure photon counting errors and error bars including this systematic error added in quadrature. 2.2. Data from Other Sources In addition to the IRTF data, we include in our analysis data from other observatories presented in the literature (both the GRB Coordinate Network Circulars and preprints by Masetti et al. 2000 and Jensen et al. 2000). These data are summarized in Table 2. For data points reported multiple times, we use the most recently reported value. In particular, for the Uttar Pradesh State Observatory data we take values from Masetti et al. (2000) rather than Sagar et al. (2000).

Two early‐time K′ data points come from Calar Alto data of Stecklum et al. (2000) and Subaru data of Kobayashi et al. (2000a, 2000b). Flux values from both were measured relative to the Garnavich et al. (2000a) star A. The use of a uniform reference star allows the data from multiple observatories to be compared with reasonable confidence. Residual differences in color terms should be small since all three observatories used the same photometric bandpass. To allow for color terms, we have used 2000a, 2000b). Similarly, the optical data reported in the literature and used in this paper have all been calibrated to either stars A–D of Garnavich et al. (2000a) (for some R‐band data) or to the photometry of Henden et al. (2000) (for other optical filters and the rest of the R‐ band data). The R‐band fluxes measured by Henden et al. for stars A–D agree with those from Garnavich et al. within the uncertainties, which are ∼5%. The mean and median magnitude differences between the two calibrations are 0.050 and 0.036 mag, respectively, in the sense that Garnavich et al. report brighter magnitudes than do Henden et al. The possibility of inconsistent photometric zero points in different data sets therefore amounts to about 0.05 mag between authors using calibrations from the two alternative sources, and less for authors using the same calibration. The two largest sets of uniformly reduced optical data currently available are Masetti et al. (2000) and Jensen et al. (2000). Both groups use the Henden et al. calibration. We have increased all R‐band fluxes reported on the Garnavich et al. (2000a) zero point by 0.04 mag to adjust all R‐band photometry to the Henden et al. (2000) zero point. Another possible systematic difference between photometry from different observatories is color term differences. To estimate the importance of these effects, we compare the magnitude difference between the GRB afterglow and a comparison star for thick and thinned CCD chips behind a standard Cousins R filter (Bessell 1990). The quantum efficiency of a thick chip was approximated by R‐band spectral region.) We take the afterglow spectrum to be a power law with Gunn Stryker (1983). The result depends on the color of the comparison star. For stars with the colors of unreddened G0 to K4 dwarfs (which includes stars A and D of Garnavich et al. 2000a), the difference in inferred magnitude for the two Jensen et al. (2000) explicitly address this issue by using comparison stars of color similar to the GRB afterglow in their analysis. A final possible source of error arises from possible “crowded field” effects in the photometry. Star A is located 6 from the GRB afterglow. With sufficiently poor seeing, aperture photometry of the afterglow might be affected by the wings of this star’s point‐spread function (PSF). We have estimated the magnitude of this error as a function of aperture size and seeing through numerical calculations with a Gaussian PSF model. We find that photometric errors from this source are negligible ( (FWHM). They remain seeing provided that the photometric aperture radius used is ≤1Masetti et al. (2000) and Jensen et al. (2000), is more robust to such errors. The ultraviolet flux at Hubble Space Telescope STIS spectrum of the afterglow (Smette et al. 2000b). This measurement was § 6 below, but is consistent with a wavelength‐independent intrinsic slope if intergalactic Lyman line absorption is considered (Madau 1995). 3. LIGHT‐CURVE FITTING Both the K′ and R light curves are shown in Figure 1. The K′‐band light curve shows a smooth rollover from an initially constant flux to a rapid decay at late time. The R‐band light curve shows a qualitatively similar behavior, but the early‐time R flux decays more steeply than the early K′ flux, and there are additional irregularities in the R‐band light curve that are arguably significant (e.g., Masetti et al. 2000; Sagar et al. 2000). Fig. 1.— Light curves of the GRB 000301C afterglow in both K′ and R filters. The data are summarized in Table 2. Smoothly broken power‐law fits using the empirical fitting form in eq. (1) are shown as solid lines where they interpolate the data, and as dotted lines where they are extrapolations. The fitted parameters are given in the text. Filled circles are K′ filter data and open circles are R filter data. Broken power laws can be empirically fitted by functions of the form Stanek et al. (1999) used to fit the light curve of GRB 990510 is the special case where The K′ light curve can be well fitted by this model. The best‐fit values (with The R‐band data show significant departures from such a light curve. The first R‐band data point is clearly fainter than the extrapolation of the other early R data. If we exclude this point, the best fit to the R data has Kumar Panaitescu 2000b) or refreshed shock effects (Panaitescu, Meszaros, Rees 1998; Dai Lu 2000). Either explanation suggests that the K′ data should show similar effects. To test this, we examine the behavior of R−K′ below. If we assume a fixed R−K′ color and compare the K′ data to the R‐band light‐curve model, the best‐fit color is R−R data (31 points), and the data − model residuals in R yield 2 is due to the presence of the bump, drop, and plateau in this time interval. In short, the smooth R‐band fit does not describe the R data very well in this time period, but does an even worse job describing the K′ data. 4. R−K′ COLOR VARIATIONS To assess the significance of the light‐curve fit differences above, we have examined in detail the R−K′ colors of the afterglow for the six K′ data points. At each epoch, we use selected R data points to obtain the most reliable interpolated or extrapolated R flux at the time of the K′ measurement. All measurements are adjusted to the zero point of Henden et al. (2000). Details for each epoch follow. March 3.215.—We interpolate between the March 3.21 and March 3.25 Nordic Optical Telescope measurements by Jensen et al. (2000), obtaining R− March 3.55.—We take a weighted average of the three measurements from March 3.51 (Garnavich et al. 2000a; Halpern, Mirabal, Lawrence 2000a; Veillet Boer 2000a, 2000b). We apply corrections to place the first two epochs on the Henden et al. zero point, and further add 0.02 mag to adjust the R flux to the K′ epoch, one hour later. (This corresponds to a local March 4.64.—We combine four R measurements from March 4.48 to 4.50 (three from Jensen et al. 2000; one from Halpern et al. 2000b, adjusted by 0.05 mag to the Henden et al. zero point) and interpolate to the March 4.909 point of Bhargavi Cowsik to obtain R− March 5.61.—We extrapolate the March 5.63 R‐band point from Veillet Boer (2000b) the K′ epoch, obtaining March 6.595.—This epoch is during the “plateau” in the R‐band light curve (Bernabei et al. 2000). Fitting a single power law through the R data from March 6.135 to March 7.22, evaluating it at March 6.595, and estimating the flux error through Monte Carlo simulations, we find R− March 8.590.—We use the R data from March 8.146 through 9.52. We again fit a single power‐law decay through all the R data, evaluate it at the epoch of the K′ measurement, and determine the error bar from simulations. The result is R− These values of R−K′ are plotted as a function of time in Figure 2. If we assume a single R−K′ color throughout the afterglow, the best fit is R− Fig. 2.— R−K′ color evolution of the GRB 000301C afterglow. The dashed line shows the best‐fit single color, R−K′ measurement and an interpolated R flux. We consider three possible explanations for the observed variation of R−K′ with time. First, it is possible that the color variations are real. Second, as suggested by Masetti et al. (2000), it may be that there are no true color variations, but that the afterglow exhibits achromatic fluctuations on timescales short compared to the interval between observations. If so, the fluctuations need to have amplitude ∼10% and to occur on timescales 2 to 5 (so that K′ and interpolated R fluxes. Given the discussion of systematic errors above and our effort to adjust all R‐band fluxes to the Henden et al. calibration, this large an additional error is unlikely. We therefore believe that at least some of the measured color variation is real. 5. SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS The long spectral baseline between the K′‐band (2.1 μm) and the optical/UV bands allows one to obtain accurate spectral slope measurements. We have calculated the burst SED at selected times based on the availability of multiwavelength data. Where necessary, flux measurements were interpolated between adjacent data points at one wavelength in order to determine a contemporaneous flux with another wavelength. For this operation, we always interpolated the light curves with good sampling (R, K′) to match the time of a sparsely sampled wavelength (UV 3050 Å, B). Photometric zero points for the conversion of magnitudes to flux density units were taken from Fukugita, Shimasaku, Ichikawa (1995) for the optical, and from Campins, Rieke, Lebofsky (1985) for the near‐IR. The resulting SEDs are shown in Figure 3. The best‐fit spectral slopes assuming unbroken power‐law spectra are given in Table 3, first uncorrected for extinction; then with a correction for foreground Galactic extinction (Schlegel, Finkbeiner, Davis 1998) assuming an K′ data alone, corrected only for Galactic extinction. Fig. 3.— Spectral energy distribution of the GRB 000301C afterglow in the observer‐frame near‐IR to near‐UV is plotted for selected epochs. Left panel: SEDs corrected for Galactic extinction only. Note the slight but significant curvature of the SED at the earliest epoch, when the errors are smallest.

The last column gives the slope measured using the R and K′ filters alone, corrected for Milky Way extinction only, to isolate the time evolution of the burst from possible systematic differences among filters. Host galaxy extinction corrections assume Pei 1992). The broadband SEDs plotted in Figure 3 show no compelling evidence for extinction at the redshift of the GRB. (This is a change from the first preprint of this paper, largely due to revised calibration of the March 6.375 UV data point at 3050 Å.) However, a modest amount of host galaxy extinction remains consistent with the data. The 2175 Å dust absorption feature falls into the observed R‐band at the redshift Figure 3 the SEDs corrected for 2/dof (1.45 for 4 degrees of freedom) for the residuals of the plotted SEDs relative to the spectral slopes reported in Table 3. LMC extinction does marginally worse than SMC extinction, while any amount of Milky Way extinction in the host degrades χ2. We have used the analytic extinction law fitting forms of Pei (1992) in deriving these estimates. Jensen et al. (2000) have applied a similar analysis incorporating optical spectra as well as broadband colors. They also find a significantly better fit for SMC extinction than for either MW or LMC extinction, and derive § 5). The apparent weakness of the 2175 Å feature in the extinction curve of the host galaxy is reminiscent of dust attenuation laws for actively star forming galaxies (e.g., the Magellanic Clouds [Pei 1992 and references therein] and starburst galaxies [Gordon, Calzetti, Witt 1997]). This may be further circumstantial evidence linking GRBs to actively star forming galaxies. Alternatively, such an extinction law might be observed if GRBs preferentially destroy the small carbonaceous particles thought to be carriers of the 2175 Å feature, but this explanation would only work if much of the dust optical depth arises near the maximum radius where the burst can destroy grains (see Waxman Draine 2000; Fruchter, Krolik, Rhoads 2000d). In order to determine physical parameters of the afterglow, we need to measure the peak flux density and the locations of breaks in the afterglow spectrum (Wijers Galama 1999). We now do this (insofar as possible) by combining our optical‐IR spectral slope measurements with the submillimeter and radio data. We are looking for four numbers: The frequency max and flux density p/2 for Sari, Piran, Narayan 1998). Here p is the power‐law index of electrons recently accelerated at the external shock of the expanding GRB remnant. Extrapolating the optical‐IR spectral slopes to lower frequencies, we see that a strong spectral break is required near or above the 250 GHz measurement by Bertoldi (2000) on March 4.385. The radio data from March 5.67 (Berger et al. 2000) are compatible with Fig. 4). Using fluxes corrected for both Galactic dust and Berger et al. (2000) that is shown in Figure 4. We conservatively estimate Fig. 4.— Spectral energy distribution of the GRB 000301C afterglow from 250 GHz to 0.44 μm on UT 2000 March 4.385 (2.974 days post‐GRB), and at 1.43, 4.86, 8.46, and 22.5 GHz on UT 2000 March 5.67 (4.26 days post‐GRB). Filled circles show the photometric data corrected for both Galactic foreground and GRB host galaxy extinction (see text). Solid lines show the ±1 σ fitted power law slopes through these fully corrected optical/IR data. Open points show the optical/IR data corrected for only foreground Galactic extinction, and dotted lines show the ±1 σ fitted power law slopes through these data points. Finally, dashed lines show the The location of the cooling frequency 1997, 1999). The early‐time R‐ band data (excluding the discrepant March 2.906 data point) gives Bednarz Ostrowski 1998; Gallant, Achterberg, Kirk 1999) and experience with other afterglows give typical values p are marginally consistent with the early time data if we adopt Kumar Panaitescu (2000b). If we consider the early‐time K′ light curve, p. Overall, we regard 6. PHYSICAL PARAMETERS OF THE AFTERGLOW We can use the observed SED of GRB 000301C to place interesting limits on some of the afterglow’s physical parameters, using the method of Wijers Galama (1999). To do so, we assume that the afterglow is reasonably approximated by a spherical burst (or a section thereof) expanding into a uniform ambient medium up to the time of our SED measurement. Even if the light‐curve break is attributed to a jet, the method should work for times before the break. We take the spectrum to peak at either of the values derived above (−3. Here E is the kinetic energy of the ejecta, n is the number density of the ambient medium. We obtain limits rather than measurements because of the relatively weak constraints on Wijers Galama 1999). If we allow −3. We have used 15 Hz at 3 days, then the bounds on E and n rises as Wijers Galama 1999). On the other hand, It is interesting to compare our estimate of E with the gamma‐ray fluence of the burst. Jensen et al. (2000) estimate a fluence of −2 in the 25–100 keV band and a corresponding energy of 7. DISCUSSION GRB 000301C is the third burst for which a strong break in the light curve is clearly observed. Several classes of breaks are predicted by fireball models. The most basic of these are due to features in the synchrotron spectrum moving through the observed bandpass (e.g., Paczyński Rhoads 1993; Sari, Piran, Narayan 1998). However, this class of features predicts relatively modest changes in light‐curve slope, with the break occurring first at short wavelengths and evolving to longer ones. Jetlike burst ejecta, on the other hand, are expected to give strong breaks that are essentially independent of wavelength (Rhoads 1997, 1999; Sari, Piran, Halpern 1999), and the observed breaks have generally been interpreted as evidence for collimation of the GRB ejecta (e.g., in GRB 990123 [Castro‐Tirado et al. 1999; Kulkarni et al. 1999; Fruchter et al. 1999; and Galama et al. 1999] and in GRB 990510 [Stanek et al. 1999; Harrison et al. 1999]). A difficulty with this model is that the predicted break is quite gradual (Rhoads 1999; Panaitescu Meszaros 1999; Moderski, Sikora, Bulik 2000; Kumar Panaitescu 2000a), while observed breaks are rather sharp. The current burst is no exception. The prediction of Rhoads (1999) for the light curve around the break time for a collimated jet is where Rhoads (1999). The break in this predicted light curve is extremely broad, and would give χ2 little better than a single power law in fitting the observed break in either K′‐ or R‐band. The model curve is based on numerical integration of the remnant’s dynamical equations, and ignores differences in light travel time between the center and edge of the remnant, which will only smooth the break further (e.g., Moderski et al. 2000; Panaitescu Meszaros 1999). If we ignore the issue of break sharpness and fit a collimated jet model to the observed R‐band light curve, we can infer the opening angle from the measured break time. To do so, we need a reasonable measurement of n, since the inferred opening angle scales as Rhoads 1999). We use n more precisely, we use the column density Jensen et al. 2000) and estimate the linear size of the source as ≲0HST images. This implies a number density −3 of the sky if the jet is bipolar. The transition to the nonrelativistic regime has been proposed as another mechanism for light‐curve breaks both in this burst (Dai Lu 2000) and others (Dai Lu 1999). However, we do not know of a detailed calculation of the sharpness of this break, making a fair evaluation of this possibility difficult. Light travel time effects seem likely to broaden this feature to A final possible cause for sharp breaks in GRB afterglow light curves is discontinuities in the ambient density distribution. Assuming that the density is a function of radius alone, a minimum timescale for breaks due to such discontinuities is t is the time elapsed in the observer’s frame since the burst and Kumar Panaitescu 2000b). If we believe that the observed R−K′ variations are real, then the greatest difficulty posed by the observations of GRB 000301C is in finding a model whose light curve steepens in K′ before it steepens in R. For most mechanisms, breaks will occur either first at short wavelengths (e.g., the cooling break), or simultaneously at all wavelengths (e.g., “beaming” breaks). One speculative way out is to suppose that a discontinuity in the ambient density is encountered while the cooling break is between the R and K′ filters. The predicted appearance of an afterglow at frequencies above and below this break is expected to differ qualitatively: A high‐frequency image would show an annular structure and a low‐frequency image a more nearly filled disk. This is caused by the difference in the apparent dynamical age of the remnant along the line of sight (where we see things changing quickly) and near the edge of the observed afterglow (where light travel time is larger, and we see material at an earlier and hotter stage of its evolution) (e.g., Granot, Piran, Sari 1999.) Now, the same variation of “lookback time” from the center to edge of the afterglow implies that we see the effect of an ambient density drop first in the middle of the afterglow, and that the fractional effect of such a discontinuity on the afterglow flux will initially be larger at long wavelengths than short ones. This mechanism can reproduce the sign of the observed effect. Detailed calculations would be necessary to see if it can approach the observed magnitude, given that the two filters are separated by only a factor of 3 in wavelength. 8. SUMMARY We present a K′‐band (2.1 μm) light curve of the GRB 000301C afterglow, combining four epochs from a Target of Opportunity program at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility with two additional measurements from Calar Alto (Stecklum et al. 2000) and Subaru (Kobayashi et al. 2000a, 2000b). This light curve can be well fitted by a broken power law evolution, with a very flat early time slope (R‐band (0.7 μm) data from the literature yields steeper slopes (−0.7 and −2.8) and a later break time. A detailed analysis of the R−K′ colors shows modest deviations from constant color, which are significant at the ∼2 σ level. These may indicate the presence of systematic errors ≳0.08 mag due to inhomogeneous data sets. However, we believe that the likely level of such systematic errors is ≲0.05 mag, and that at least part of the color variability is likely real. The strong break and steep late time slope in the light curves are reminiscent of GRB 990510, which has been interpreted as a collimated burst (Stanek et al. 1999; Harrison et al. 1999; Kumar Panaitescu 2000a). If we fit a collimated burst model to the R‐band light curve, the estimated opening angle becomes 2 However, while a jet model can reproduce the size of the break, it does not provide a natural explanation for the observed rapidity of the break. Nor, however, do other models. Indeed, there is considerable variability in the R‐band light curve of GRB 000301C on timescales Fitting a standard synchrotron spectral energy distribution to the burst, we place the peak of 12 Hz (300 μm). The dominant uncertainty in this measurement is the correction for extinction in the GRB host galaxy. Random errors are ≈0.10 dex in K′ observations. Combining the measured spectral peak with constraints on the cooling frequency and self‐absorption frequency, we infer that the blast wave energy required to power this afterglow was   It is a pleasure to thank the NASA IRTF director and staff for making this observing program possible.

We find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in any tidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the cluster lives long enough for the overdensities to build up.The distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the cluster centre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and the strength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time, while for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causing a periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distance oscillate with time. We provide an approximation for estimating the distance of the overdensities in this case.We describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidal tails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal field on the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous. Moreover, we conclude that a pericentre passage or a disc shock is not the direct origin of an overdensity within a tidal tail. Escape due to such tidal perturbations does not take place immediately after the perturbation but is rather delayed and spread over the orbit of the cluster. All observable overdensities are therefore of the mentioned two types. In particular, we note that substructured tidal tails do not imply the existence of dark matter substructures in the haloes of galaxies.",

        "body": "1 INTRODUCTION Since an increasing number of tidal structures are being discovered around the Milky Way (e.g. Odenkirchen et al. 2001; Belokurov et al. 2006; Grillmair Dionatos 2006; Grillmair 2009; Jurić et al. 2008; Keller, Da Costa Prior 2009; Koch et al. 2009), there is a profound interest for a deeper physical understanding of tidal tails. Tidal tails offer direct constraints on the ongoing dissolution process of star clusters as well as on the last few Gyr of their evolution. Furthermore, their alignment, shape and structure give a unique opportunity to reconstruct the cluster's orbit in unprecedented detail and thus probe our understanding of the Milky Way potential. From the simple assumption that a star cluster has a nearly constant mass-loss rate on its orbit about the Galactic Centre, its tidal tails are often expected to have a more or less homogenous and smooth structure. Substructure in the tidal tails is usually only expected in time-variable tidal fields when the mass-loss rate varies with time. However, in a recent paper (Küpper, Macleod Heggie 2008a, hereafter KMH) we analytically predicted and numerically proved the formation of substructure in tidal tails even within a constant tidal field. This effect is due to an epicyclic motion of stars evaporating from the cluster instead of the more common approximation of linear motion along the tails (for details see KMH). Like a standing wave this motion leads to statistical overdensities if it is performed by a stream of stars. We were able to show that these epicyclic overdensities arise at a distance of many tidal radii along the orbit from the cluster centre and also gave a simple relation between this distance and the tidal radius of the corresponding cluster. The numerical verification was done for a fairly simple N-body model, using a point-mass galaxy and a star cluster without a stellar mass spectrum, to avoid all disturbing influences. More recently, this effect has also been studied by Just et al. (2009) in a more general context, showing that, even in a Milky Way like potential and with a cluster consisting of stars drawn from a mass function, these over and underdensities arise and can give valuable information on the current state of the cluster. In KMH, we found that the pre-requisite for the formation of epicyclic overdensities is that a majority of escaping stars leaves the cluster with velocities slightly above the escape velocity through one of the two Lagrange points. If the scatter in escape conditions is too large, the statistical overdensities are expected to vanish. For constant tidal fields, this condition has been shown to be well fulfilled, but for time-variable tidal fields this has not been investigated yet. For star clusters on eccentric orbits or on orbits involving periodic disc shocks, the tidal field varies with time and the internal evolution of the cluster is perturbed. Thus, the scatter in escape conditions may be increased such that epicyclic overdensities may not be able to arise. How large the influence of the perturbation is depends on the orbital parameters. Therefore, we here investigate a comprehensive set of N-body simulations of globular clusters on different orbits about a Milky Way like potential, and study the formation of substructure within the tidal tails (Section 3). Within the models, we also look for overdensities in the tails which can be assigned to a tidal variation and an associated change in the mass-loss rate. But first a few theoretical considerations have to be set out to explain the various aspects of escape and, in this context, explain our methodology (Section 2). 2 THEORY OF ESCAPE Understanding the formation of tidal tails, and especially of substructure within those tails, is relatively easy in the ideal case of a star cluster on a circular orbit about a spherically symmetric galaxy as studied in KMH. Escape from such a cluster can be theoretically described in the framework of epicyclic theory in which the equations of motion of escaping stars are fairly simple. KMH showed that stars, when they evaporate with small velocities from the cluster through one of the Lagrange points, move on oscillatory orbits along the tidal tails. These oscillations lead to periodic stellar over and underdensities when they are performed by a constant stream of escapers. But, how does this change for more complex clusters in time-variable tidal fields? Since the formation of substructure in the tails, as described in KMH, is due to stars evaporating from the cluster and in a constant tidal field evaporation is mass loss driven by two-body relaxation (Küpper, Kroupa Baumgardt 2008b), we argue that the more stars escape with evaporative escape conditions from the cluster, i.e. escape with low speed through one of the Lagrange points, the more pronounced are the overdensities and the easier it is to observe overdensities beyond the first one. In time-variable tidal fields, this does not necessarily mean that (i) escape has to be due to two-body relaxation, since pericentre passages during eccentric orbits and disc shocks also create escapers, as they enhance the mass-loss rate in general (Vesperini Heggie 1997; Baumgardt Makino 2003) or (ii) escape has to happen from the Lagrange points, as the distance of the Lagrange points from the cluster centre may vary more quickly on eccentric orbits than the cluster profile does. On the other hand, time variations in the tidal field, and associated variations in the mass-loss rate, are also the most frequently suggested formation mechanism for substructure in tidal tails (Dehnen et al. 2004). However, this mechanism has not been convincingly proven in numerical experiments yet. Therefore, we need to study the mass-loss rate and the escape conditions of the investigated models in detail to understand the origin of detected substructure. 2.1 Mass-loss rate 2.1.1 Constant tidal fields The time-scale of evaporation in constant tidal fields is the relaxation time, trh, as the mass loss of a tidally limited star cluster can be approximated by (1)(Baumgardt 2001). The median two-body relaxation time is furthermore given by (Spitzer 1987) (2)where N is the number of stars, Rh is the half-mass radius, G is the gravitational constant, m is the mean mass (M/N) and ln Λ the Coulomb logarithm where Λ is of the order of 0.11 N in the case of equal masses (Giersz Heggie 1994a). For clusters on circular orbits, the tidal field is static and the cluster will dissolve as a result of two-body relaxation and the interactions of stars with the tidal field, where the mass-loss rate is determined approximately by the ratio of half-mass radius to tidal radius (Gieles Baumgardt 2008). For such time-independent tidal fields, the tidal radius scales with M1/3 hence decreases rather slowly with ongoing mass loss. Since the change in the half-mass radius also happens rather slowly, the mass-loss rate is approximately constant during one revolution about the Galactic Centre. Hence, substructure in the tidal tails can only arise through the epicyclic motion of escaping stars. 2.1.2 Time-variable tidal fields If the cluster moves on an eccentric orbit or if the cluster periodically crosses the galactic disc then additional energy is put into the cluster on an orbital time-scale and the mass-loss rate is expected to vary during one revolution. As the galactocentric distance of the cluster periodically changes on an eccentric orbit, the tidal radius is not monotonically decreasing any more but varies during one period. Furthermore, because the structure of the cluster may not be able to change rapidly enough, a part of the cluster may (temporarily) lie beyond the tidal radius when the cluster is at pericentre, where the tidal radius reaches its minimum. This induces a strong pull on those outlying stars, increasing on average the stellar energies. When the tidal radius increases again, a fraction of these once outlying stars may be recaptured but now with increased energy. The rest will be lost from the cluster. This whole process is often loosely referred to as bulge shocking (for a detailed discussion of tidal shocking, see e.g. Gnedin, Lee Ostriker 1999). During a disc shock, the cluster is temporarily compressed on a time-scale smaller than the internal dynamical time-scale. As a consequence of this, all stars get a kick, accelerating some stars (mostly the stars in the outer parts) to velocities above the escape velocity, and these are then likely to leave the cluster. This behaviour can be described, for example, in the formalism of the first- and second-order theory of disc shocks as reviewed in Gnedin et al. (1999). Here, the mean energy changes, 〈ΔE〉 and 〈ΔE2〉, of the stars within the cluster can be expressed as (3) (4)where gm is the maximum vertical gravitational acceleration of the disc while r and v are the positions and velocities of the corresponding stars. The dependence on r2 makes clear that, on the one hand, a cluster is more affected by a shock when it is more extended, and on the other hand the outer stars are most likely to be pushed to energies above the escape energy. Moreover, the energy shifts from equations (3) and (4) become less influential with increasing galactocentric radius of the disc shock since the vertical gravitational acceleration decreases. Vesperini Heggie (1997) found that disc shocks at solar radius and beyond are almost negligible for realistic globular cluster configurations. 2.1.3 Delayed escape In both types of time-dependent tidal field, pericentre passages and disc shocks, the stars most affected are at radii comparable to the (apogalactic) tidal radius. At these radii, the orbital time-scale of stars within the cluster is of the order of the orbital time-scale of the cluster within the galaxy. For constant tidal fields, Fukushige Heggie (2000) have shown that a star which is pushed to an energy just slightly above the escape energy cannot escape from the cluster easily but has to pass near one of the two Lagrange points, as the potential barrier is lowest there. This significantly increases the escape time of stars from a cluster (Baumgardt 2001). What happens in the case of time-dependent tidal fields has not been investigated yet. Nevertheless, for somewhat non-circular orbits it is likely that, for many affected stars, escape will be delayed until well after the pericentre passage or the disc shock. This delay in escape of a specific star may even last several revolutions, since the star may need several orbits within the cluster to escape, as in the circular case. Hence, the time variation of the tidal field need not lead to detectable overdensities within the tidal tails as suggested by Dehnen et al. (2004) if the fraction of delayed escapers is large and escape events are spread in time. However, the formation of epicyclic overdensites will still be possible, even if a majority of stars leaves the cluster as a result of tidal variations, as long as the escape conditions of the escaping stars are evaporation like, i.e. escape with low velocities. 2.2 Escape conditions 2.2.1 Constant tidal fields Giersz Heggie (1994b), Baumgardt, Hut Heggie (2002) and Küpper et al. (2008b) were able to show that for clusters (in constant tidal fields) the escape velocities of the majority of escaping stars follow a lognormal distribution when normalized to the specific velocity dispersion of the cluster. This behaviour can be understood in terms of two-body relaxation: the velocity distribution within the cluster is almost Maxwellian and stars in the high-velocity tail of this distribution are deemed to leave the cluster as their velocities exceed the escape velocity of the cluster. The latter is furthermore linked to the velocity dispersion for clusters in virial equilibrium. Hence, the ratio of the escape velocity of an escaping star to the velocity dispersion of the cluster at that time is expected to be constant. Since the velocity dispersion changes rather slowly with time, stars in the tidal tails have quite similar escape conditions (which we call here evaporative escape conditions) leading to thin and dynamically cold tidal tails with observable epicyclic overdensities. 2.2.2 Time-variable tidal fields As mentioned above, tidal variations affect the velocities of cluster stars. Hence, for strong tidal variations the velocity distribution does not necessarily have to be nearly Maxwellian any more. Furthermore, the tidal radius and thus the escape velocity of the cluster changes during one revolution about the Galactic Centre. In addition, the velocity dispersion periodically varies with time as the cluster gets compressed or oscillates. Finally, the cluster can even be temporarily out of virial equilibrium. From these considerations, we may expect that the escape conditions have a larger spread around a mean value and may even deviate from lognormal and become asymmetric. In the extreme case of a cluster which gets completely disrupted through a single shock, the scatter in escape conditions will be maximal. Thus, broad and dynamically hot tidal tails without epicyclic overdensities are expected from this crude picture. The intermediate regime, from perfectly evaporative escape conditions to maximally perturbed conditions, will be the subject of our parameter space study. 2.3 Number and orbital velocity distribution We are going to analyse the tidal tails of our models in terms of number and orbital velocity distributions, in order to try to find the origin of any observed overdensities and relate them to the tidal radius of the cluster. In other words, motivated by the results of KMH, we investigate the number distribution of stars along the tidal tails and compare it to the average orbital velocities of stars at that position within the tails. Epicyclic motion of a constant stream of stars leaving the cluster creates over and underdensities at periodic distance intervals. For constant tidal fields, the distance of the density enhancements only changes when the conditions of escape are modified, e.g. when the tidal radius changes. Furthermore, the oscillatory (epicyclic) movement also creates a signal in the orbital velocity of the stars along the tails, as was first discovered by Capuzzo Dolcetta, Di Matteo Miocchi (2005) in numerical simulations: places where the stars move fastest (slowest) should correspond to the positions of underdensity (overdensity) (cf. KMH). To analyse the clusters in a consistent way, all stars are binned along the orbit in bins of size 25 pc. For this purpose, we calculate points, Rj, along the orbit of the cluster at separations of 25 pc and assign the tail stars to the point which they are closest to. The resulting distribution gives the number density of stars as a function of distance from the cluster centre along the orbit. In addition, the average orbital velocity with respect to the cluster within the jth bin, vj, is measured as (5)where vij is the speed of the ith star in the jth bin, Nj is the number of stars in the jth bin and V(Rj) is the speed the cluster will have or had at the position Rj of the orbit (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the velocity dispersion in each bin is calculated with (6)where is the mean velocity in the jth bin and is the mean squared velocity, respectively. 2.4 Tidal radius and distance yC In KMH, we theoretically predicted and numerically verified a relation between the positions of the overdensities, yC, and the tidal radius of the cluster, xL. For a cluster in a point-mass galactic potential, the position of the first overdensity is (7)but for the general case the relation gets more complicated. The distance of the first overdensity is then given by (8)where Ω is the angular velocity of the cluster on its orbit about the Galactic Centre and κ is the so-called epicyclic frequency (see KMH). The latter comes from epicycle theory, where the motion of a star is approximated by the circular motion of a guiding centre about the Galactic Centre and an oscillation of the star about this guiding centre (cf. Binney Tremaine 1987). In this framework, the epicyclic frequency for a cluster moving in a planar orbit is given by (9)Here, Φ is the galactic potential and R is the galactocentric radius of the cluster. The epicyclic frequency gives a quantification of the steepness of the galactic potential in the radial direction and the strength of the centrifugal force, and therefore naturally appears in the equation for the tidal radius (as the distance of the Lagrange points from the cluster centre is usually called): (10)where G is the gravitational constant. The epicyclic frequency obviously has a large influence on the value of xL. While the relation κ = Ω holds for point-mass galaxies, the value for a Milky Way like potential may vary between approximately 0.5Ω and 2Ω. Fortunately, the flat rotation curve of the Milky Way implies that there is a wide range of galactocentric distances within the disc where κ is about (11)(cf. fig. 3 in Just et al. 2009). As mentioned above, this theory only holds for nearly circular orbits. In the case of arbitrary orbits in complicated potentials, these approximations break down and no simple solutions to the equations of motion can be found. In the following analysis, the tidal radius is always determined by combining equations (9) and (10), i.e. (12)The angular velocity is furthermore calculated using (13)where R is the position of the cluster with respect to the Galactic Centre and V its velocity. The basic quantities which we investigate (bound mass, mean stellar mass, etc.) will be calculated for all stars within this theoretical radius, and the distance of the detected overdensities relative to the density centre compared to it. This distance, yC, should only be related to the tidal radius if the overdensities are of epicyclic origin. 2.5 yC in the case of time-dependent tidal fields There is no theory for the distance of the epicyclic overdensities, yC, in the case of time-dependent tidal fields yet. But, we can estimate the distance between the cluster and the epicyclic overdensities, even when the system gets periodically accelerated and decelerated on an eccentric orbit or through a galactic disc, if we make further assumptions as follows. (i) First, we have to consider the fact that the acceleration of the cluster and of the stars in the tails will change with time. Consequently, the distance between any two points moving along the orbit is not constant but changes according to the orbital phase. What stays constant due to angular momentum conservation though is the difference between the times at which the two points pass a certain point of the orbit. We can therefore convert the distance yC into a conserved time difference Δt. For constant tidal fields, yC can be expressed as (14)where V is the magnitude of velocity of the cluster on its circular orbit about the galaxy and Δt is the time difference at which the cluster and the overdensity pass a certain point of the orbit. (ii) For eccentric orbits or orbits including disc shocks, the cluster and its tails get periodically stretched and compressed as the velocity of the cluster and the tails changes during a period. The distance between two points which are separated by a given amount of time, Δt, can be written in a Taylor expansion as (15)where A is the acceleration at the given point. Since V and A are well known for our models, the separation of two points which would be at a constant distance in a constant tidal field, e.g. the cluster and the first-order overdensity, can be calculated for a time-variable tidal field. (iii) Furthermore, we will assume that the time variations of the tidal field are sufficiently fast that the cluster cannot adapt to the changing environment, but rather behaves as if it experiences a single mean tidal field along its orbit. For this purpose, we will average the galactocentric distance, R, and the orbital velocity, V, and use these quantities to calculate an average yC using equation (8) and assuming a circular orbit at the given mean galactocentric distance. The results of these assumptions will be checked in Section 3.4, but the following argument explains why assumption (iii) is reasonable. The length of the epicycle, which escaping stars follow after they leave the cluster vicinity, depends on the offset of the star from the cluster centre perpendicular to the orbit (see KMH or Just et al. 2009 for a more detailed discussion). In a constant tidal field, this offset is the tidal radius. But for time-variable tidal fields, the stars do not necessarily have to escape from the tidal radius, as this radius might change faster than the cluster can adapt to the changing tidal conditions. In fact, stars escape from what we might refer to as the ‘edge’ of the cluster, whose radius changes little during one orbit. Indeed, recent studies show that stars escape preferentially from a radius approximately equal to the apogalactic tidal radius of the cluster; furthermore they have low velocities, making the formation of epicyclic overdensities likely, even in the case of non-circular orbits (Küpper et al., in preparation). (iv) Finally, by applying equation (14) we can estimate a time by which the cluster and the overdensity should be separated on their orbit. With this approximate value of Δt, we have all the ingredients to predict the behaviour of yC with time during one orbital period using equation (15). 2.6 Mean drift velocity The time escaping stars need to complete one epicycle, e.g. the time that passes from the time a star leaves the cluster until it reaches the first overdensity, is given by (16)and in KMH we also showed that the distance between the overdensities is given by equation (8). Thus, we can determine a mean drift velocity of the stars within the tidal tails with respect to their guiding centre by using (17)where the minus (plus) sign holds for the leading (trailing) tail. Hence, the mean drift velocity depends on the tidal field properties through κ and xL. This equation is only valid for circular orbits, though. For circular orbits in the galactic disc of the Milky Way, the mean drift rate is about (18)where we used equations (10) and (11). For a constant mass-loss rate, the density within the tails is therefore increasing with decreasing mass as the angular velocity of the cluster is constant whereas the tidal radius decreases monotonically. Hence, the stars propagate more slowly along the tails the less massive the cluster is. In time-dependent tidal fields, the mean tidal conditions used in the formalism of Section 2.5 may be applied to get a rough estimate of the mean drift velocity. But, due to the compression and stretching of the tails throughout the orbit a drift velocity in a literal sense is not meaningful. The mean drift velocity, vC, which is calculated in the rotating reference frame of the leading or trailing tail, can be converted into the average orbital velocity of Section 2.3, which is measured in the reference frame of the cluster, by making a correction, , for the difference in orbital velocity of the guiding centre of the corresponding tail to the orbital velocity of the cluster. This correction emanates from the left part of the right-hand side of equation (4) in KMH, which gives the offset of the guiding centre of the tails from the cluster centre, multiplied by the angular velocity Ω, and reads (19)where the plus (minus) sign holds for the leading (trailing) tail. The average orbital velocity in the tails with respect to the cluster, , is then given by (20) (21)This equation gives the mean value of the velocity profile along the tidal tails which will be measured in the following investigation using equation (5). 3 NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION The aim of this section is to trace the behaviour of tail formation from the ideal case of KMH to the complex case of a realistic star cluster. Therefore, we start with a star cluster like the one of KMH and, as a first step, add a mass spectrum to the cluster stars (Section 3.2) to see if it affects the formation of epicyclic overdensities. Thereafter, we change the point-mass galactic potential to a Milky Way potential with bulge, disc and halo (Section 3.3). This will then be our reference model for the rest of this paper, i.e. we will compare each model with this one. Afterwards, we study the influence of different orbital types on the formation of substructure. First, the orbit is changed from circular to eccentric (Section 3.4) and then a set of computations is made with circular orbits but perpendicular to the disc (Section 3.5) to get an idea of the importance of disc shocks on cluster evolution. Additionally, all these kinds of orbits are computed at galactocentric distances of 4250, 8500, 12 750 and 17 000 pc. First, the clusters at an initial galactocentric radius of 8.5 kpc are discussed, but the effect of changing this radius is studied separately in Section 3.6. An overview of the models can be found in Table 1. 3.1 The setup The initial clusters are chosen such that they can represent the Milky Way globular cluster Palomar 5 (which is itself about 10 Gyr old) during the last 3 Gyr of evolution, i.e. rather ‘fluffy’ with a ratio of half-mass radius to tidal radius of about 0.2 (Harris 1996). We do this because Pal 5 is the only globular cluster with prominent tidal tails in which significant substructure has been found (Odenkirchen et al. 2001, 2002, 2003). Furthermore, there are hardly any clusters present in the Milky Way which are more vulnerable to tidal influences than Pal 5. Most globular clusters in the Milky Way are much more compact and therefore can resist pericentre passages or disc shocks much better. Hence, the complete set gives us an idea of the maximum importance of a wide range of realistic tidal influences on star clusters and their tidal tails. All computations were performed with the collisional N-body code nbody4 (Aarseth 1999, 2003) on the grape-6a supercomputers at the AIfA (Fukushige, Makino Kawai 2005). The internal initial conditions of the chosen clusters are all similar: the clusters contain 65 536 stars drawn from a canonical, two-part power-law initial mass function (Kroupa 2001, 2008) ranging from 0.1 to 1.2 M⊙; this results in a total cluster mass of about 20 000 M⊙, which is comparable to the mass of Pal 5 3 Gyr ago as estimated by Dehnen et al. (2004). The stars follow a Plummer density profile with a half-mass radius chosen such that Rh/Rtide = 0.2 for a circular orbit, i.e. all clusters at a given apogalactic distance use the same cluster setup to ensure comparability among each other. The clusters are set up as isolated clusters and then put into the tidal field, such that there is a tide-dependent unbound fraction of stars at the very beginning, which is in most cases negligible and mostly results in a slightly higher mass-loss rate at the beginning of the computations. The clusters do not contain any primordial binaries because binaries would significantly enhance the CPU demand without adding to the problem at hand. Furthermore, stellar evolution is neglected to focus on dynamical effects. After setup, the calculations were carried out for 4 Gyr if possible. Only one cluster was computed for a point-mass galactic potential; for all other clusters, a Milky Way potential consisting of bulge, disc and spherical halo as described in Allen Santillan (1991) was used. For the latter potential, the equation for xL (equation 10) cannot be used unrestrictedly, because it only holds for spherical symmetric potentials in which the total angular momentum is naturally conserved or for orbits lying in the plane of symmetry, i.e. for orbits in the disc, for which the component of the angular momentum perpendicular to the disc is conserved. Nevertheless, even for the orbits which do not lie in the plane of symmetry the equation is valid to a sufficient degree of accuracy because the variation of the total angular momentum is only of the order of 10 per cent. 3.2 Point-mass galaxy, circular orbit The step from a cluster consisting of single-mass stars to a multimass cluster is necessary, although no deviation from the theoretical predictions of KMH is expected, since the solutions to the equations of motion of stars leaving a cluster through its Lagrange points (equations 4–6 therein) do not depend on the masses of the stars. The only thing to check is whether the evaporative escape conditions are still fulfilled. But, as discussed in KMH, in constant tidal fields this condition is better fulfilled the more stars there are within the cluster, and here we are dealing with 64k stars compared to N = 1000 in KMH. Furthermore, Just et al. (2009) already proved the formation of epicyclic over and underdensities for this kind of cluster. Nevertheless, we perform this experiment to confirm our methodology. Fig. 2 shows a snapshot of the system at t = 2.0 Gyr when the cluster has a bound mass of about 16 300 M⊙, i.e. a tidal radius of 33 pc. The cluster clearly shows overdensities at the predicted positions of about yC = ±12πxL ≃ 1250 pc and even shows signs of the second- and third-order overdensities at ± 2yC and ± 3yC, respectively (which are not visible in the plot because the plotted range of y is restricted to facilitate comparison with similar plots for other clusters). Also, the orbital velocity with respect to the cluster in the lower panel of Fig. 2 clearly shows the predicted signal of periodic acceleration and deceleration. Moreover, the average orbital velocity in this figure is in good agreement with the predictions of equation (20), yielding an average orbital velocity of about with respect to the cluster for the values of Ω and xL given in the caption of Fig. 2. From this figure, we can also see that most escaping stars have a velocity which is larger than the escape velocity, by the following argument. Equation (8) gives the distance of the first epicyclic loop for a star which passes the Lagrange point with vanishing velocity; this distance is about 1250 pc in Fig. 2. If a star has an excess velocity, v, at the moment of escape then the length of the epicycle increases (see equation 22 in Just et al. 2009) as (22)In Fig. 2, the first epicyclic maximum is at about 1500 pc. This is consistent with equation (22) if we assume that the average excess velocity is about 0.34 km s−1. 3.3 Milky Way potential, circular orbit The cluster described in this section will be the reference for all following clusters, since all of them are moving in the same galactic potential but on more complex orbits. Here, we discuss some basic evolutionary parameters of this cluster (i.e. bound mass, Lagrange radii and mean stellar mass) and only point out significant differences for the other clusters in the following sections. The aim is to understand the evolution of the reference cluster in detail before we look at the tidal tails and the overdensities therein. 3.3.1 Internal evolution Putting the cluster of Section 3.2 into a Milky Way potential will not significantly change its evolution as long as it still moves on a circular orbit in the disc and with the same angular velocity. The only change is the steepness of the potential which, in the formalism described above, alters the epicyclic frequency, κ2, and therefore changes the value of the tidal radius. Since the Milky Way potential in the disc falls off less steeply, ∂2Φ/∂R2 is smaller and the tidal radius therefore larger. This cluster is not perturbed by a time-dependent tidal field. Hence, as no external energy comes in, its lifetime is longest (Fig. 3). During the first 500 Myr, there is a small burst of primordial escapers. Thereafter, the mass-loss rate is about constant. After 4 Gyr, the cluster still has about 75 per cent of its initial mass and is only just beginning to go into core collapse (Fig. 4). The core radius, RC, in this figure shows the internal dynamical evolution of the reference cluster. It is calculated using the algorithm (cf. Casertano Hut 1985) (23)where ri is the distance of the ith star from the density centre and ρi is the mass density around this star, computed using the distance to its fifth closest neighbour and the mass within this radius. A good indicator for the formation of epicyclic overdensities is ongoing two-body relaxation in the cluster, as escape due to two-body relaxation ensures evaporative escape conditions (Section 2.2). In Fig. 5, the mean mass of bound stars versus bound mass is shown. Since a cluster is expected to lose preferentially low-mass stars, as those are most probably accelerated to velocities above the escape velocity, and this effect is due to energy equipartition (via two-body relaxation), Fig. 5 gives a measure of the effectiveness of two-body relaxation for the escape of stars. The preferential loss is clearly visible in all clusters. We can see that the reference cluster, as it is the most unperturbed one, shows the earliest increase in mean mass with decreasing bound mass. 3.3.2 Evolution of the tidal tails As we have seen that two-body relaxation plays a major role in the dissolution process, and escape due to two-body relaxation leads to epicyclic overdensities, the reference cluster also shows the expected density enhancements at the predicted positions (Fig. 6). As mentioned in Section 2.4, we can use κ = 1.4Ω for this orbit in the Milky Way potential, which gives (24) (25)Hence, the epicycles of the escaping stars are about four times shorter than in the case of a point-mass galaxy while the tidal radius is almost 10 per cent larger. Still, the epicyclic approximation is correct, as can be seen in Fig. 6, where the binned stars along the tidal tails are shown at 2.0 Gyr when the cluster has a bound mass of about 16 400 M⊙. The corresponding tidal radius and the predicted position of the first overdensity, yC, are given in the figure caption. As in Fig. 2, the first-order epicyclic maximum is at a somewhat larger distance than the predicted yC. The difference is about 50–100 pc which, using equation (22), corresponds to an average excess velocity of about 0.27–0.55 km s−1. The lower panel of Fig. 6 also shows the predicted velocity variations. Moreover, the average orbital velocity with respect to the cluster is again in good agreement with the predictions of equation (20), which yields an average orbital velocity of about kms−1 for the given parameters. This average value is intuitively expected, since the rotation curve of the assumed galactic potential is almost flat at this galactocentric radius. The role of the flat rotation curve can be nicely seen by comparing Fig. 6 with Fig. 2 where larger velocity differences between the leading and trailing tidal tails are seen. When comparing Fig. 6 with Fig. 2, which show similar clusters at the same dynamical state, i.e. at a bound mass of about 16 000 M⊙, but in a different tidal field it should be noted that, besides the fact that yC is approximately four times larger in Fig. 2, the overdensities are also far more extended in Fig. 2, also by a factor of about 4. Furthermore, the peak density outside the cluster is larger by a factor of 2 in the case of the more realistic reference cluster. This is due to the mean drift velocity of the stars along the tidal tails (equation 17). Comparing vC for the two clusters we see that, while the escaping stars of the cluster in the point-mass potential have a mean drift velocity of about 5 km s−1, the tail stars of the reference cluster move with only about 2 km s−1 along the tail, i.e. the tail is denser on average because the mass-loss rate of both clusters is approximately the same (see Fig. 3). This implies that the tails of the reference cluster, and especially its overdensities, would be much easier to observe. Fig. 7 shows a time series of the number distribution along the tidal tails. In this figure, the cluster is omitted to allow a larger dynamical range in the representation of the number density of the tails. The first- and second-order overdensities can be seen with distances decreasing slightly with time as the mass, and hence the tidal radius, of the system monotonically decreases. There is also an initial transient overdensity, which propagates rapidly away from the cluster at small times. This is due the initial presence of ‘primordial escapers’ (Section 3.1), and is an artefact of the initial conditions. But it is an interesting feature, as it illustrates how very differently the overdensities evolve if they are due to a single pulse of mass loss. 3.4 Milky Way potential, eccentric orbits We study the influence of pericentre passages on the formation of tidal tails by using eccentric orbits, but remain within the disc in order to avoid disc shocks. The eccentricities, ε, of the chosen orbits are 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75, where (26)The clusters start at a radius of 8.5 kpc and have an initial velocity which is reduced by a corresponding amount compared to the circular velocity, and hence 8.5 kpc is their apocentre distance. The corresponding values of Rperi can be found in Table 1. 3.4.1 Internal evolution The clusters computed in this way dissolve faster than the reference cluster (Fig. 3), which is expected, because the more eccentric the orbit the stronger is the average tidal field (Baumgardt Makino 2003). Furthermore, for an eccentricity of 0.25 there are already small periodic wobbles, which are visible in Fig. 3 and grow with increasing ε. These are due to the periodically changing value of the tidal radius xL, which is smallest at pericentre, and this sets loose a fraction of stars, of which most are recaptured by apocentre. As discussed in Section 2.1.3, due to this recapture, stars are not lost in a pulse during a pericentre passage: the mass curve rather follows a smooth line (if the pericentre dips are neglected), and not a series of steps. This behaviour, in which we follow the mass within the tidal radius calculated using equation (10), is very different from the behaviour found by Dehnen et al. (2004, their fig. 4), who included only stars lying within the initial tidal radius for the computation of internal quantities of the cluster, such as the total mass. Their approach suggests that stars are lost in pulses during pericentre passages or disc shocks, which is in strong contrast with our finding. Differences in the initial conditions, orbital parameters, galactic model and even computational method all have a role in this comparison. We note, however, that recent results (Küpper et al., in preparation) show that for computations of internal quantities it is more appropriate to use the apogalactic tidal radius or the mean tidal radius mentioned in Section 2.5. While the strength of these dips in the mass curve do not reflect permanent escape, they do indicate what fraction of stars is seriously affected by a pericentre passage or a disc shock, since it shows how many stars are at large radii and get temporarily unbound. [Those stars which are most affected by a pericentre passage or a disc shock are those at large radii (cf. equations 3 and 4).]. But, as we can see in these dips, not all stars that have been once outside the tidal radius are lost from the cluster. As mentioned in Section 2.1.3, the loss of these outlying stars cannot happen instantaneously, essentially because their orbital time about the cluster is of the order of the orbital time of the cluster about the Galactic Centre. The finite breadth of the dips (e.g. for ε = 0.25) also tells us that not all eccentricities lead to tidal shocks in a classical sense. Therefore, we have tried to avoid using the term shock in connection with eccentric orbits, and speak of the more general pericentre passages, which implies a broader range of time-scales. The behaviour we are describing can be observed in Fig. 8, where the time evolution of mass shells of the cluster with an eccentricity of 0.5 and an apocentre distance of 8.5 kpc is shown. The figure demonstrates the periodic expansion and compression of the whole cluster, but the amplitude is much smaller than the change in tidal radius. Superimposed on this externally induced oscillation is the internal dynamical evolution of the cluster. While the innermost shells are contracting due to mass segregation, the remaining shells are expanding. If a shell gets unbound during a pericentre passage, it will expand thereafter, where the amount of expansion depends on the time the shell spends outside the tidal radius. If this time is short (e.g. the curve for 80 per cent in Fig. 8 at about 750 Myr), the expansion will be slow enough that the shell can be recaptured by the growing tidal radius when the cluster moves from peri to apocentre. A recapture will decelerate the expansion or even reverse it. When no recapture is possible, the shell will quickly move away from the cluster vicinity within a fraction of the cluster orbital period. Here again it can be seen that escape happens throughout the whole orbit and is not heavily concentrated at perigalacticon. But how does the eccentricity of the orbit affect two-body relaxation in the cluster and what is the effect on the escape conditions? Fig. 5 shows that preferential loss of low-mass stars is increasingly suppressed compared to the reference cluster with increasing eccentricity, since the fraction of lost stars with arbitrary masses increases. Nevertheless, all clusters show an increasing mean stellar mass, such that two-body relaxation is evidently at work. Provided that the escape conditions for a majority of stars are still evaporative, and the eccentricity of the orbits does not induce too large a large scatter in escape conditions, we may still expect that epicyclic overdensities will arise. We now examine the tidal tails to check this expectation. 3.4.2 Evolution of the tidal tails The tidal tails of clusters on eccentric orbits behave differently from those of clusters on circular orbits in several ways. First of all, the coordinate system in which the cluster is at rest is no longer uniformly accelerated, and therefore the epicycle approximation cannot be applied without modification. For this reason, the solutions of the equations of motion of KMH (therein equation 4–6) do not hold any more. Hence, there is no simple relation between the tidal radius and the distance of the density maxima unless we make further assumptions (Section 2.5). Nevertheless, the equation for the tidal radius (equation 10) is still valid since the orbits lie in the plane of symmetry of the potential and therefore the angular momentum is conserved. But, the value of ∂2Φ/∂R2 now changes with time as the galactocentric distance oscillates, and the angular velocity, of course, also varies with time. This gives a variation of the tidal radius (between peri and apocentre) of the order of 90 per cent of the apogalactic value for ε = 0.75 for the clusters with an apogalactic distance of 8.5 kpc. 3.4.3 Epicyclic overdensities As we expected from theoretical considerations above, we also find epicyclic overdensities in the tidal tails of clusters on eccentric orbits. Indeed, all clusters in the range of eccentricities we studied show these overdensities. The epicyclic origin of the overdensities we have found can be seen by looking at time series of the number distribution along the tidal tails, as the distance yC should be related to the tidal radius. Since the tidal radius is large at apocentre and small at pericentre, the density maxima are expected at a larger distance at apogalacticon and vice versa. But, the opposite is the case, which is due to the non-linearly accelerated rest frame: from apo to perigalacticon, the cluster and its tails get accelerated and stretched, while from peri to apocentre the tails get compressed as the whole system is decelerated (cf. Piatek Pryor 1995). Hence, at pericentre the cluster is fastest and the distance between the maxima is largest, whereas the maxima and the whole tails get most compressed at apogalacticon – which is also the explanation why the tidal tails of Palomar 5 are so clearly visible since it is near the apocentre of its orbit about the Galaxy (Odenkirchen et al. 2003). If we apply the assumptions of Section 2.5, we can predict the positions of the overdensities even for the eccentric orbits. Therefore, we average the galactocentric radius and the orbital velocity of the cluster for each model in Table 2 and estimate a time difference, Δt, by which the cluster and the first-order overdensity should be separated in reaching the same phase of the orbit. The variations of yC for the different orbital types at a fixed mass of 20 000 M⊙ are shown in Fig. 9 for several revolutions. Obviously, the distance yC now strongly depends on the position of the cluster on its orbit; from apo to pericentre it varies increasingly with increasing eccentricity. This periodic change of yC is also observable in Fig. 10 where the change of the number distribution along the tidal tails with time is shown for the cluster at an apogalactic distance of 8.5 kpc and an eccentricity of 0.25. While the reference cluster (Fig. 7) shows the predicted monotonic decrease of yC, the clusters on eccentric orbits have an orbital variation imprinted on this monotonic decrease. Our estimate from Section 2.5 shows good agreement with the simulations; both vary by a factor of 1.7 about a mean value which is lower than the corresponding value of the reference cluster. The same holds for the cluster with an orbital eccentricity of 0.5, shown in Fig. 11. The epicyclic overdensities in this figure are quite faint compared to the initial mass loss, which is due to primordial escapers. Nevertheless, the location of the first-order epicyclic overdensity is in good agreement with the predictions made using the formalism of Section 2.5,1 supporting the assumptions made for this purpose. While yC in Fig. 9 varies for an eccentricity of 0.25 by a factor of about 1.5 between maximal and minimal distance from the cluster centre, and for an eccentricity of 0.5 by a factor of 2.7, the amplitude of variation for ε = 0.75 is even a factor of 7.5. Moreover, for the latter eccentricity the compression at apogalacticon is so strong that the overdensities are literally pushed back into the cluster such that they overlap with each other and the cluster and nearly disappear in our number distribution plots. 3.4.4 Asymmetry overdensities The non-uniform acceleration along the orbit also leads to an asymmetry in extended tidal tails, since in the case when the cluster is exactly at apocentre, for example the leading tail is already accelerating towards the Galactic Centre while the trailing tail is still slowing down. The difference in acceleration results in an asymmetry in compression between the leading and the trailing tail, and thus in an asymmetric stellar density within the two tails. The asymmetry increases with a larger eccentricity and is also visible in the velocity distribution along the tidal tails. Nevertheless, the epicyclic overdensities stay visible throughout the whole orbital period. We demonstrate this for the cluster with an orbital eccentricity of 0.5 but at an apogalactic distance of 12.75 kpc. We do this because we generated outputs of nbody4 every 10 Myr throughout our computations, and for clusters at smaller apogalactic distances the time resolution is too poor for a convincing demonstration. For this cluster with ε = 0.5, the orbital time is about 170 Myr, we therefore show 12 consecutive snapshots starting at 970 Myr in steps of 10 Myr in Fig. 12. At that time, it has a mass of about 14 000 M⊙ and is first close to pericentre, then at 1040 Myr in apocentre and in the last panel, at 1080 Myr, on its way to pericentre again. Not only is the compression significant, increasing the stellar density within the tails by, at least, a factor of 3 at apogalacticon compared to perigalacticon, but also the asymmetry is clearly visible and can be followed throughout the snapshots wandering from right to left (indicated by a black arrow) and enhancing the number density by a factor of about 2 compared to the same part in the opposite tail. This asymmetry may be interpreted as another overdensity type, which may be very helpful for determining the orbit of an observed cluster like Pal 5. The most important point about the studied pericentre passages is that all observed overdensities are due to epicyclic motion of escaping stars or an asymmetric acceleration of the tidal tails. There is no detectable overdensity being obviously the result of a pericentre passage (if we neglect the loss of the primordial escapers during the first revolution). Hence, even for the most eccentric orbits studied here, the conditions of slow escape are well fulfilled for a majority of escapers such that epicyclic overdensities can be observed. This further supports the assumptions made in Section 2.5 which will be further investigated in Küpper et al. (in preparation). 3.5 Milky Way potential, inclined orbit We study disc shocks using a cluster on a circular orbit with 90° inclination to the disc. The tidal field which this cluster experiences is essentially the same as the one of the reference cluster, except for two disc shocks per revolution which put additional energy into the cluster according to equations (3) and (4). In Fig. 3, we can see that the effect of disc shocks at 8.5 kpc on the mass evolution of a cluster of the given concentration is not significant, in agreement with results from Vesperini Heggie (1997) and Gnedin et al. (1999). Similar as in the reference cluster, the factor ∂2Φ/∂R2 (which is important for the calculation of the tidal radius but has nothing to do with the shock itself as it only reflects the potential change in the radial direction) is as good as constant within one orbit and just the angular velocity changes slightly when the cluster is accelerated or decelerated by the disc. This results in the orbit being slightly non-circular due to the non-spherical potential. The effective eccentricity is only about 0.04, though (see Table 1). This small non-zero eccentricity has a negligible effect on the evolution of the cluster. The internal evolution of the cluster is also quite similar to the reference cluster (Fig. 5). Hence, epicyclic overdensities are observable in the number distribution of stars along the tidal tails, as can be seen in Fig. 13 where the evolution of the tidal tails with time is shown. As the disc periodically accelerates and decelerates, the cluster quite similarly to an eccentric orbit, the overdensities and the overall shape of the tails also get slightly compressed and stretched. With the formalism which we introduced in Section 2.5 and the values for the mean galactocentric radius and the mean orbital velocity, we can predict the behaviour of yC for this model. The result is shown in Fig. 14 and is in satisfactory agreement with the N-body results as shown in Fig. 13. Important about this model is that no overdensity due to a disc shock can be observed within the tails, i.e. there is no group of escapers moving along the tidal tail. All overdensities are due to epicyclic motion of escaping stars and mass loss due to a shock does not happen instantaneously with the shock, but happens delayed along the whole orbit as described in Section 2.1.3. Furthermore, disc shocks do not significantly increase the scatter in escape conditions for the epicyclic overdensities to vanish. 3.6 Orbits at 4.25, 12.75 and 17 kpc To see whether the behaviour of the cluster, and especially of the tails, changes when the strength and the duration of the pericentre passages and disc shocks are varied, we investigate all of the above models at three further galactocentric distances of 4.25, 12.75 and 17 kpc. The initial conditions of the test cluster are adjusted to the given tidal field, i.e. a Plummer model with a half-mass radius such that Rh/Rtide = 0.2, since Tanikawa Fukushige (2005) as well as Gieles Baumgardt (2008) have shown that the ratio of half-mass and tidal radius significantly determines the evolution of a cluster. Hence, our setup is a reasonable choice for a good comparability. On the other hand, due to the fixed ratio of half-mass radius and tidal radius we simultaneously change the two-body relaxation time-scale with these adjustments. Most globular clusters of the Milky Way lie below the ratios studied here (Harris 1996), i.e. are more compact and, hence can resist tidal perturbations more easily and have a smaller two-body relaxation time. 3.6.1 Internal evolution In Fig. 15, the mass evolution of all clusters at 4.25, 12.75 and 17 kpc is shown. As mentioned above, since all clusters have the same initial concentration the two-body relaxation time decreases for the clusters closer to the Galactic Centre. Therefore, the dissolution of the models on circular orbits is stronger the closer the model is to the Galactic Centre. Moreover, an increasing influence of pericentre passages for decreasing galactocentric radii can be seen when comparing the models on eccentric orbits at a given apogalactic distance with the respective circular model. Models with a smaller apogalactic distance go deeper into the bulge at perigalacticon and hence are more strongly influenced by the tidal field variations as the angular velocity and hence the stress on the cluster grows with decreasing galactocentric radius. In Fig. 16, the mean stellar mass within the clusters is plotted versus the bound mass left in the cluster. An earlier increase in mean mass shows that the two-body relaxation time-scale is short compared to the time-scale of dissolution of the cluster. Therefore, the probability of observing epicyclic overdensities grows for models with an earlier increase in mean mass. As we can see from the figure, all models show an increase in mean stellar mass. Especially at 4.25 kpc, where the two-body relaxation time is shortest, most models show a steep increase in mean stellar mass and epicyclic overdensities are therefore expected. From our sample, just the model at 4.25 kpc with eccentricity of 0.75 dissolves so quickly (Fig. 15) and shows so little increase in the mean mass (Fig. 16) that we would not expect observing epicyclic overdensities in this case. 3.6.2 Evolution of the tidal tails As shown in KMH, in the case of a cluster in a constant tidal field, i.e. on a circular orbit, epicyclic overdensities are generated by stars which escape from the cluster as a result of two-body relaxation. The tidal variations studied in this work enhance the mass loss of the investigated clusters and also the scatter in escape conditions. For most orbital parameters, two-body relaxation seems to be actively involved in the dissolution of the cluster such that the influence of the tidal variations cannot be too violent. We indeed find epicyclic overdensities for all our models. In Fig. 17, we show as an example the disc–shock model at 4.25 kpc in a time series of the number density along the tidal tails. The figure shows two pronounced orders of overdensities which oscillate, as the cluster is accelerated and decelerated by the galactic disc, and in mean decrease in distance as the cluster loses mass. Contrary to our expectations, even the most extreme cluster in our sample, the one at 4.25 kpc with an eccentricity of 0.75, is able to grow epicyclic overdensities. Its lifetime is very short; the cluster survives for only about three revolutions. Still this is sufficient for most of the escaping stars to go through at least one epicyclic loop. In Fig. 18, this cluster is shown at t = 140 Myr when it has a mass of about 3000 M⊙ and has completed about 5/4 revolutions about the galaxy (one epicycle of an escaping star takes about 1/2 revolution). The mean stellar density in the tails in this case is comparatively high as many stars are lost from the cluster, such that we had to increase the scale on the y-axis. The first-order epicyclic overdensities are prominently imprinted. The orbital velocity of stars shows no clear variation along the tails except the large-scale variation due to the orbit about the galaxy. The velocity dispersion in the corresponding bins are quite large, though. This indicates that the scatter in escape conditions is large. Nevertheless, there must be a dominant speed and a dominant radius from which stars escape such that they interfere constructively and the observed overdensities can build up. In the end, our numerical investigation has convincingly shown that we have to anticipate epicyclic overdensities whenever we observe tidal tails. 4 CONCLUSIONS Our numerical investigation has shown that star clusters always grow epicyclic overdensities of the kind predicted in KMH. We were able to prove this for a large variety of orbits and for a test cluster which is comparatively fluffy (large ratio of half-mass radius to tidal radius) and hence more vulnerable to tidal influences than most star clusters of the Milky Way. Only in very extreme conditions, if the cluster gets literally disrupted by a single shock, the overdensities would not be able to arise, as they need a certain time (about one to two orbits) to build up. Since this would imply that such a cluster has a very low chance of being observed, we can conclude that epicyclic overdensities can be found in any star–cluster tidal tail on the sky. In KMH, we argued that the epicyclic overdensities arise if a majority of stars leaves the cluster with evaporative escape conditions, i.e. with a velocity just slightly above the escape velocity when escaping from the cluster through one of the two Lagrange points. For clusters on circular orbits, these conditions are established via two-body relaxation. Pericentre passages and disc shocks perturb the evolution of a cluster and increase the scatter in escape conditions. Nevertheless, we observe epicyclic overdensities for all tested clusters. The influence of pericentre passages and disc shocks on the escape conditions therefore has to be rather moderate for the investigated range of orbital parameters. Since most clusters of the Milky Way are more compact than our test cluster, the average influence of eccentric orbits or disc shocks on the escape conditions should be even weaker than in our investigation. In KMH, we showed that the distance from the cluster centre to the first epicyclic overdensity, yC, is a multiple of the tidal radius. Hence, as the cluster constantly loses mass and the tidal radius consequently gets smaller, yC monotonically decreases with time. Here, we showed that this is just the case for circular orbits, since for eccentric orbits the periodic acceleration and deceleration of the tidal tails leads to a stretching and compression of the whole system and therefore periodically increases and decreases yC (e.g. Fig. 10). At apocentre, yC is minimal as the system is maximally compressed while at pericentre yC reaches its maximum value. The strength of the variation in yC depends on the eccentricity and is a factor of about 7.5 for an eccentricity of 0.75 (Fig. 9). However, on the mean, yC decreases with time as the cluster evaporates. We furthermore provide an approximation for estimating the distance yC in the case of time-variable tidal fields (Section 2.5). It is based on the assumption that the cluster experiences a mean tidal field on its orbit, as it is not able to react to the tidal variations in time. This assumption also suggests that escape from a cluster in a time-dependent tidal field happens from the ‘edge’ of the cluster, which is comparable to the apogalactic tidal radius, rather than from a theoretically determined tidal radius. Küpper et al. (in preparation) show that the radius of the ‘edge’ of a cluster in the given range of orbital parameters stays approximately constant during one period. Hence, the assumptions are justified and the theoretical predictions agree well with the N-body results. Moreover, we found further over and underdensities which arise through the non-uniform acceleration of the stars within very extended tidal tails; since tails may easily span several kpc, different parts may experience very different forces and have significantly different velocities. This leads to a non-uniform stretching and compression of the tidal tails causing a large-scale variation of the stellar density along the tails (Fig. 11). This effect may be very helpful for determining the orbit of an observed cluster like Pal 5. Throughout our investigation, we were not able to detect overdensities which could be attributed to a pericentre passage or a disc shock, i.e. a bunch of stars which gets unbound during one tidal event and is then moving in a group along the tail. Furthermore, we have shown that the mass-loss rate is approximately constant for all kinds of orbits when the tidal radius is calculated using equation (10). The mass-loss rate is larger for more eccentric orbits or orbits with disc shocks closer to the Galactic Centre, but does not cause steps in the mass curve, if the pericentre dips are neglected (Fig. 3). This is due to a delay in escape of stars which get energetically unbound through a tidal event. We argue that the stars which are most affect by these events orbit the cluster at radii comparable to the apogalactic tidal radius of the cluster. The orbital times of those stars within the cluster is of the same order as the orbital time of the cluster within the galaxy. Escape therefore does not happen instantaneously, but the stars leave the cluster delayed with respect to the tidal event, where the delay of a specific star may last several orbital times (Fig. 8). As a consequence of this, we furthermore suggest to use the apogalactic tidal radius for the computation of internal quantities rather than the perigalactic tidal radius as has often been done in numerical studies. The Milky Way globular cluster Palomar 5 is the only cluster with prominent, extended tidal tails which, furthermore, show significant substructure. The most detailed numerical investigation of this cluster has been performed by Dehnen et al. (2004) but they were not able to reproduce the substructure within their models. Instead of adding substructure to the Milky Way potential like spiral arms or giant molecular clouds to increase the time variations of the tidal field, or adding dark matter subhaloes to the Milky Way potential to perturb the dynamically cold tidal stream, as suggested by Dehnen et al., we suggest that most overdensities within the tails of Pal 5 are of epicyclic origin or are due to an asymmetric acceleration along the tails. Another interesting object for this kind of analysis is the recently discovered GD-1 stream (Grillmair Dionatos 2006; Koposov, Rix Hogg 2009), which is thin and thus kinematically cold. Even though the progenitor of this stream has not been found yet, it is most probably emanating from a globular cluster which may have dissolved by now. This stream also shows substructure which may help to locate the position of the cluster within the stream since the lowest orders of epicyclic overdensities (the overdensities closest to the cluster) are always most prominent. There have also been stellar overdensities discovered without any trace of a tidal stream or an object to which they can be attributed to, for example, the Boötes II dwarf spheroidal (Koch et al. 2009). With ongoing and future surveys looking for stellar overdensities in the Milky Way halo, the number of such objects may well increase. To ease the identification of these objects as epicyclic overdensities within tidal tails which are themselves below the detection limit, we are going to provide a detailed investigation with predictions for observers including such factors as radial velocity signatures, the stellar mass function, typical sizes and masses, etc., in a future contribution.

        "abstract": "Context. A tight correlation exists between far-infrared and radio emission for star-forming galaxies (SFGs), which seems to hold out to high redshifts (z ≈ 2). Any excess of radio emission over that expected from star formation processes is most likely produced by an active galactic nucleus (AGN), often hidden by large amounts of dust and gas. Identifying these radio-excess sources will allow us to study a population of AGN unbiased by obscuration and thus find some of the most obscured, Compton-thick AGN, which are in large part unidentified even in the deepest X-ray and infrared (IR) surveys. <BR /> Aims: We present here a new spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting approach that we adopt to select radio-excess sources amongst distant star-forming galaxies in the GOODS-Herschel (North) field and to reveal the presence of hidden, highly obscured AGN. <BR /> Methods: Through extensive SED analysis of 458 galaxies with radio 1.4 GHz and mid-IR 24 μm detections using some of the deepest Chandra X-ray, Spitzer and Herschel infrared, and VLA radio data available to date, we have robustly identified a sample of 51 radio-excess AGN (~1300 deg<SUP>-2</SUP>) out to redshift z ≈ 3. These radio-excess AGN have a significantly lower far-IR/radio ratio (q 〈 1.68, 3σ) than the typical relation observed for star-forming galaxies (q ≈ 2.2). <BR /> Results: We find that ≈45% of these radio-excess sources have a dominant AGN component in the mid-IR band, while for the remainders the excess radio emission is the only indicator of AGN activity. The presence of an AGN is also confirmed by the detection of a compact radio core in deep VLBI 1.4 GHz observations for eight of our radio-excess sources (≈16%; ≈66% of the VLBI detected sources in this field), with the excess radio flux measured from our SED analysis agreeing, to within a factor of two, with the radio core emission measured by VLBI. We find that the fraction of radio-excess AGN increases with X-ray luminosity reaching ~60% at L<SUB>X</SUB> ≈ 10<SUP>44</SUP> - 10<SUP>45</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, making these sources an important part of the total AGN population. However, almost half (24/51) of these radio-excess AGN are not detected in the deep Chandra X-ray data, suggesting that some of these sources might be heavily obscured. Amongst the radio-excess AGN we can distinguish three groups of objects: i) AGN clearly identified in infrared (and often in X-rays), a fraction of which are likely to be distant Compton-thick AGN; ii) moderate luminosity AGN (L<SUB>X</SUB> ≲ 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) hosted in strong star-forming galaxies; and iii) a small fraction of low accretion-rate AGN hosted in passive (i.e. weak or no star-forming) galaxies. We also find that the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of the radio-excess AGN are on average lower that those observed for X-ray selected AGN hosts, indicating that our sources are forming stars more slowly than typical AGN hosts, and possibly their star formation is progressively quenching.Tables 1, 3 and Appendices are available in electronic form at <A href=\"http://www.aanda.org\">http://www.aanda.org</A>",

        "body": "1. Introduction The discovery of a strong correlation between the properties of galaxies and those of the supermassive black holes (SMBH) hosted in their centres, such as the MBH − Mbulge or MBH − σ relations (Ferrarese Merritt 2000; Gebhardt et al. 2000; Magorrian et al. 1998; Marconi Hunt 2003), has pointed out that SMBHs must play an important role in the growth and evolution of galaxies (see Alexander Hickox 2012, for a general review). In the past decades many studies have focussed on understanding the relation between nuclear activity (AGN) and host galaxies and have revealed a common history, where both star formation and black hole accretion were much more common in the past, with a peak at redshift z ≈ 2 (e.g. Fiore et al. 2003; Hopkins et al. 2006b, 2007; Marconi et al. 2004; Merloni et al. 2004, 2007). Completing the census of AGN activity, especially at redshifts where most of the accretion occurred, is therefore essential in order to understand the nature of the link between SMBH and galaxies and their cosmic co-evolution. This paper aims to expand our knowledge of the AGN population, by selecting objects with radio emission in excess of that expected from star formation. As discussed below, this method selects many AGN that cannot be identified using other established techniques, and so moves us closer to a complete census of growing SMBHs in the Universe. Deep X-ray surveys have proved to be a very powerful tool in detecting obscured and unobscured AGN down to faint fluxes and to high redshifts (z ~ 5; e.g. Alexander et al. 2001; Brusa et al. 2009; Fiore et al. 2003; Hasinger 2008; Lehmer et al. 2012; Xue et al. 2011). However, it is now evident that even the deepest X-ray surveys are not complete (e.g. Hasinger 2008; Tozzi et al. 2006) and miss a significant part of the AGN population, in particular the most obscured, Compton-thick (CT) AGNs, where the X-ray emission below 10 keV is strongly suppressed by large column density gas (NH > 1024 cm-2). A large population of heavily obscured AGN is indeed predicted by synthesis models of the X-ray background (XRB; Ballantyne et al. 2011; Comastri et al. 1995; Gilli et al. 2001, 2007; Treister et al. 2009) in order to reproduce the high energy peak of the observed X-ray background emission (E ≈ 30 keV), which has not yet been directly resolved by current X-ray surveys. Since large amounts of gas and dust are responsible for the suppression of the radiation in the UV, optical and soft X-ray bands, perhaps the most obvious waveband to search for these heavily obscured objects is where the dust emission peaks, i.e. the infrared (IR) band. In fact, the dust surrounding the SMBH is heated by the nuclear radiation, reaching temperatures T ~ 200−1000 K, and re-emits the radiation predominantly in the mid-infrared (MIR; λ ≈ 5−40 μm) band, peaking at ~20−30 μm (Mullaney et al. 2011; Netzer et al. 2007). Moreover, at these wavelengths the effects of extinction are small, making it easier, in theory, to find even the most obscured AGN (e.g. Gandhi et al. 2009; Goulding et al. 2012). The downside of using the IR band to search for AGN activity is that dust is present not only in the circumnuclear region of AGN, but also in the host galaxy, in particular in star-forming regions. The dust in these regions is heated on average to lower temperatures, and therefore its emission peaks at longer wavelengths, than that around the black hole (typically at λ ≈ 100 μm, Tdust ~ 20−50 K; e.g. Calzetti et al. 2000; Chary Elbaz 2001). However star formation often dominates the spectral energy distribution (SED) over the entire IR band (e.g. Elvis et al. 1994; Mullaney et al. 2011; Netzer et al. 2007; Richards et al. 2006) and it is often not trivial to separate it from the AGN emission. Potentially a very powerful approach to obtaining an unbiased look at obscured and unobscured AGN is through radio observations. In fact, at radio frequencies, where the emission is mainly due to non-thermal processes, such as synchrotron radiation, the effects of extinction are negligible. Historically, AGN detected in radio surveys have been divided into two main classes: i) radio-loud (RL) AGN, which are the strongest radio emitters (typically Lrad ≳ 1024−25 W Hz-1; Miller et al. 1990; Yun et al. 2001) and show strong extended radio emission, such as kpc-scale relativistic jets and lobes, and ii) radio-quiet (RQ) AGN, the weaker radio emitters, whose radio emission is confined in a small, unresolved region (≤0.1 pc; “core”); the latter group constitutes the majority of the population (~90%; e.g. Miller et al. 1990; Stocke et al. 1992). The separation between radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN has typically been set at R = 10, where R, the radio-loudness parameter, is defined as the ratio between the monochromatic flux density in the radio and optical bands1R = Srad/Sopt (e.g. Kellermann et al. 1989; Laor 2000). However, more recent studies based on deep radio surveys have shown that while the radio-loudness parameter spans a very wide range of values for AGN, there is no clear evidence of bimodality in the population (e.g. Brinkmann et al. 2000; Cirasuolo et al. 2003; La Franca et al. 2010; White et al. 2000). AGN can therefore be identified in the radio band with a wide distribution of radio power. While at bright fluxes the radio population is almost entirely composed of AGN, at low radio fluxes (sub-mJy regime) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) constitute a significant fraction of the radio source population and become dominant at μJy fluxes (e.g. Seymour et al. 2008). The non-thermal radio continuum observed in star-forming galaxies is produced by synchrotron radiation from cosmic ray electrons and positrons, accelerated by supernova remnants, which mainly occur in young stellar populations in star-forming regions (see Condon 1992, for a review). The radio emission observed in star-forming galaxies tightly correlates with the emission in the far-infrared (FIR; λ ≈ 40−120 μm) band, since they both originate from star formation processes (e.g. Appleton et al. 2004; Condon 1992; Helou et al. 1985; Ivison et al. 2010; Yun et al. 2001). This correlation, observed primarily in local star-forming galaxies and starbursts, is found to hold out to high redshifts (z ≈ 2; e.g. Bourne et al. 2011; Ibar et al. 2008; Ivison et al. 2010; Mao et al. 2011; Sargent et al. 2010b). Joint analyses in the FIR and radio bands, therefore, allow us to separate star-forming galaxies from the AGN population. Although the weakest radio AGN (RQ) have been found to follow the same FIR/radio correlation of star-forming galaxies (e.g. Morić et al. 2010; Padovani et al. 2011), given their wide range in radio-loudness, it is possible to identify AGN via their deviation from the expected FIR/radio relation, the so-called “radio-excess” sources (e.g. Donley et al. 2005; Roy Norris 1997). Since the radio emission is not affected (or only lightly affected) by extinction, the radio-excess source selection can potentially identify AGN that are often missed in optical or even deep X-ray surveys (i.e. the most obscured Compton-thick AGN; e.g. Donley et al. 2005). In this work, we combine two methods to identify the presence of AGN in star-forming galaxies out to high redshift (z ≈ 3): i) detailed IR SED decomposition, which allows us to measure the AGN contribution to the total SED, typically dominated by star formation emission; ii) radio-excess signature compared to the typical FIR-radio relation observed for SFGs, which is most likely due to the presence of nuclear activity. We investigate here the radio-excess sources in the GOODS-North field, using deep infrared, radio and X-ray data, which are some of the deepest data available to date. The paper is organised as follows: the data and catalogues used in our investigation are presented in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, our SED fitting approach is described in details as well as the definition of the FIR-radio flux ratio (q) and the radio-excess sample selection, together with a comparison with other selection criteria used in previous studies. In Sect. 4, we investigate the X-ray, radio and IR properties of our radio-excess AGN sample and their SEDs. In Sect. 5 we discuss the mixed population found amongst our radio-excess AGN, attempting to constrain the fraction of candidate Compton-thick AGN; we also examine the star formation properties of the radio-excess AGN hosts through their specific star-formation rate (sSFR) in comparison with those of X-ray selected AGN hosts. In Sect. 6 we summarise our results and give our conclusions. In Appendix A, the tests performed to refine our SED fitting approach are explained and the best-fit SEDs for the entire radio-excess sample are shown in Appendix B. Throughout the paper we assume a cosmological model with H0 = 70 km s-1 Mpc-1, ΩM = 0.27 and ΩΛ = 0.73 (Spergel et al. 2003). 2. Observations and catalogs The Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-North field (GOODS-N; Giavalisco et al. 2004) is one of the deepest multi-wavelength surveys currently available and it constitutes an unprecedented resource in terms of its broad-band coverage and sensitivity. It covers ≈160 arcmin2 centred on the Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N, 12h36m, + 62°14′; Williams et al. 1996) and it includes very deep X-ray Chandra data (2 Ms; Alexander et al. 2003), optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST; Giavalisco et al. 2004) and mid-infrared (MIR) Spitzer observations (PI: M. Dickinson); the GOODS-N field has also been the target of several deep optical imaging and spectroscopic campaigns from 8–10 m ground-based telescopes. Recently, new deep observations of this field in the far-infrared (FIR) band with Herschel (Elbaz et al. 2011) and the radio band with VLA (Morrison et al. 2010) have usefully increased the potential of the GOODS-N data set. 2.1. Spitzer MIR data The GOODS-N field has been observed at MIR wavelengths by Spitzer at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 μm with IRAC (Fazio et al. 2004), with a mean exposure time per position of ≈23 h per band, and at 24 μm with MIPS (Rieke et al. 2004), as part of the GOODS Spitzer Legacy program (PI: M. Dickinson). The source catalogue was produced using the SExtractor source detection routine (Bertin Arnouts 1996) on a combined 3.6 μm + 4.5 μm image, with matched aperture photometry performed in the four IRAC bands individually (Dickinson et al., in prep.). The resulting IRAC catalogue includes 19437 objects detected at 3.6 μm with a ~50% completeness limit of 0.5 μJy. The 24 μm observations consist of a final mosaic image of 1.2′′ pixel scale and a 5σ sensitivity limit of ~30 μJy. The source extraction was performed with a PSF fitting technique using the positions of the IRAC 3.6 μm sources detected at >5σ as priors (see Magnelli et al. 2011, for details). The IRAC 3.6 μm data is used to define the source priors because it is ~30 times deeper than the 24 μm observations, and therefore all real 24 μm detected sources should also be detected at 3.6 μm. The resulting 24 μm catalogue includes 2552 sources detected with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) > 3 in the GOODS-N field. However, we note that in the outer regions of the GOODS-N field the MIPS data is shallower and the uncertainties on the source fluxes are typically larger; we therefore limit our catalogues to a smaller area (~135 arcmin2) within the GOODS-N field where the MIPS data is deeper (1943 sources detected at 24 μm, ~76%). We require at least a detection (S/N > 3) at 24 μm for the sources in our sample to be able to constrain the source SEDs in the MIR band (see Sect. 3.1). An area of ~150 arcmin2 of the GOODS-N field has also been surveyed at 16 μm using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) peak-up imaging (PUI) with pointings of ~10 min each. The observations and data reduction are described in detail by Teplitz et al. (2011); the resulting mosaic image is characterised by 0.9′′ pixel scale and has an average 5σ depth of ~40 μJy (Teplitz et al. 2011). The source catalogue was constructed using Spitzer-MIPS 24 μm priors (>5σ sources) and the 16 μm fluxes were calculated through PSF-fitting, similarly to the procedure used for the 24 μm data; the 16 μm catalogue contains 770 sources (Daddi et al., in prep.). 2.2. GOODS-Herschel FIR data The GOODS-N field has been observed by the Herschel Space Observatory as part of the GOODS-Herschel survey (PI: Elbaz), which consists of deep FIR observations of the GOODS-North and GOODS-South fields for a total exposure of 361.3 h. Imaging of the full northern field (GOODS-N; 10′ × 16′) was performed using PACS (Poglitsch et al. 2008) at 100 μm and 160 μm (124 h of observations) and SPIRE (Griffin et al. 2010) at 250 μm, 350 μm and 500 μm (31.2 h in total); see Elbaz et al. (2011) for details on the PACS and SPIRE observations. The data reduction was performed following the procedure described in Berta et al. (2010) and the resulting images have pixel scales of 1.2′′ and 2.4′′ at PACS 100 μm and 160 μm, respectively and 3.6′′, 5.0′′ and 7.2′′ at SPIRE 250 μm, 350 μm and 500 μm. Since the 350 μm and 500 μm data suffer from strong source blending due to the large pixel scales, we did not include data at these wavelengths in our SED fitting procedure (Sect. 3.1) and we only used the PACS 100 μm and 160 μm and SPIRE 250 μm data. The 350 μm and 500 μm flux densities and/or upper limits (S350 ≈ 20.0 mJy and S500 ≈ 30.0 mJy, 5σ) from the catalogue described in Elbaz et al. (2011) were only used in some of the plots (see e.g. Fig. B.1) to verify the accuracy of our SED fitting at these longer wavelengths. The Herschel 100 μm, 160 μm and 250 μm fluxes were calculated using PSF fitting at the positions of the Spitzer-MIPS 24 μm sources, which are used as priors (Daddi et al., in prep.). In the resulting catalogue 819 sources (~42%) have S/N > 3 in at least one of the Herschel bands: 633 sources at 100 μm, 537 sources at 160 μm and 435 at 250 μm, with 5σ (3σ) sensitivity limits of ~1.7 (~1.2) mJy, ~4.5 (~2.3) mJy and ~6.5 (~4.0) mJy, respectively. It is important to note, however, that the sensitivity of the 250 μm data strongly varies across the field, depending on the local source density of the 24 μm priors. We included in our sample all of the 1943 24 μm detected sources within the GOODS-Herschel field (restricted to the area with deeper MIPS data), with or without a significant Herschel detection; this is to avoid biases against faint FIR sources, which are more likely to be AGN dominated. 2.3. VLA radio data Deep, high-resolution radio observations of the GOODS-N field were taken at 1.4 GHz using the National Radio Astronomy Observatory’s (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) in the A, B, C and D configurations (165 h). The combined radio image reaches a rms noise level of ~3.9 μJy beam-1 near the centre with a beam size of ~1.7′′. These are amongst the deepest radio data taken so far. From the VLA image the radio flux density measurements have been obtained through PSF fitting at each 3.6 μm source position (coinciding with the 24 μm positions; see Sect. 2.1; Daddi et al., in prep.): 1.4 GHz flux measurements were obtained for all 1943 sources detected at 24 μm within the GOODS-Herschel area, with 489 sources having S/N > 3 and Sν > 13 μJy. The remaining 1454 sources have S/N 3 and they are considered as radio upper limits. Within this field, we estimated that ~20 radio detected sources (5σ) are undetected at 24 μm down to a flux limit of Sν ≈ 21 μJy; this gives an estimate of the completeness of our radio and 24 μm detected sample (hereafter VLA/24 μm sample) of ~93%, as compared to a pure radio-selected sample. We note that the detection limit adopted for our VLA radio catalogue is lower than that used in Morrison et al. (2010) (5σ detection threshold) and therefore the number of radio detections found here (489 sources) is much larger than that found by Morrison et al. (2010) over the same area (256 sources). 2.4. Chandra X-ray data The Chandra X-ray observations of GOODS-N field cover an area of ≈448 arcmin2 in the 0.5–8.0 keV energy band, with an exposure of ≈2 Ms (Chandra Deep Field North, CDF-N; Alexander et al. 2003), reaching a sensitivity (on-axis) of ≈2.5 × 10-17 erg cm-2 s-1 (0.5–2.0 keV) and ≈1.4 × 10-16 erg cm-2 s-1 (2–8 keV). The main source catalogue of the CDF-N includes 503 X-ray detected sources (Alexander et al. 2003). A supplementary catalogue containing 430 X-ray sources is also available in this field. These catalogues where constructed using a source detection algorithm with false-positive probability threshold of 10-7 for the main catalogue, and a more relaxed threshold of 10-5 for the supplementary catalogue (see Alexander et al. 2003, for details). Although this second catalogue is likely to include many spurious X-ray sources, it can be used to robustly identify fainter X-ray counterparts associated to known sources (see e.g., Sect. 3.4.2. of Alexander et al. 2003). These catalogues were used to identify the X-ray counterparts of the 489 VLA/24 μm sources. The 24 μm positions were matched to the X-ray positions using a small search radius of 1.5′′; taking into account the high positional resolution of the Chandra data (median positional uncertainties ≈0.3′′) and the small pixel size of the MIPS-24 μm images, the majority of the true counterparts are expected to lie within this radius. In fact, calculating the probability P to find a random object within 1.5′′ from the X-ray positions following the prescription of Downes et al. (1986), we obtained a maximum probability of random association P = 0.03 (considering a space density of 24 μm sources of n = 5.2 × 104 deg-2). From the main catalogue we found X-ray counterparts (in the 0.5–8 keV energy band) for 137 of the 489 VLA/24 μm sources (≈28%), with a median positional separation of ≈0.2′′. Amongst the matched sources, we found that in none of the cases was there more than one counterpart within the search radius, with the closest neighbours being at separations ≳2′′. From the supplementary catalogue we identified a further 22 X-ray counterparts to the VLA/24 μm sources, yielding a total of 159 X-ray detected sources (i.e. ≈33% of the VLA/24 μm sample). We note that since the source catalogues in all of the MIR and FIR bands considered here, as well as the VLA radio catalogue, are based on the 3.6 μm positions there was no need to cross-match the X-ray source positions with any of the other bands. For the X-ray undetected sources, 3σ upper limits were derived from aperture-corrected photometry in the Chandra images at the 24 μm source positions, assuming a power-law model with Γ = 1.4 (see e.g., Sect. 3.4.1 of Alexander et al. 2003; Bauer et al. 2010). The X-ray luminosities (2–10 keV; rest-frame) of the sources were extrapolated from the observed 2–8 keV fluxes calculated from detailed X-ray spectral analysis (Bauer et al., in prep.) and from Alexander et al. (2003) for the sources in the supplementary Chandra catalogue. We used the redshifts described in Sect. 2.5 and assumed a constant photon index Γ = 1.9 (which gives a band conversion factor L2 − 10 keV = 1.08 L2−8 keV), including appropriate k-correction. We note that the X-ray luminosities have not been corrected for absorption because the column density estimates (NH, available from Bauer et al., in prep.) often have large uncertainties; moreover, NH values were not available for the sources in the supplementary catalogue (Alexander et al. 2003). Therefore, to avoid adding further uncertainties to the X-ray luminosities and to keep consistency in the L2 − 10 keV measurements between the main and the supplementary Chandra catalogues, we did not apply any absorption corrections. 2.5. Redshifts Thanks to the large spectroscopic follow-up observations performed in the GOODS-N field, ≈3000 redshift identifications are available for the objects in this field. A compilation of spectroscopic redshifts (zspec) were obtained from the major publicly available spectroscopic redshift surveys of the GOODS-N field (i.e., Barger et al. 2008; Chapin et al. 2009; Chapman et al. 2005; Cowie et al. 2004; Wirth et al. 2004), as well as some unpublished spectroscopic redshift identifications (courtesy of Dickinson). The optical positions of the sources in these catalogues were matched with the 24 μm positions of our detected sources using a search radius of 1.0′′. Since the errors on the optical positions are typically very small, we used a smaller search radius than that used for the X-ray catalogues (see Sect. 2.4). With this search radius and considering the sky density of the 24 μm detected sources (Sect. 2.4), we estimated the spurious detections to be ~3%. Spectroscopic redshift measurements were found for 1225 sources amongst the 24 μm detected sample (~63%), with the large majority coming from the Barger et al. (2008) spectroscopic redshift catalogue (1030/1225). Two more redshift identifications were obtained from Spitzer IRS MIR spectra (Murphy et al. 2009), yielding a total of 1227 zspec measurements for our sources. In order to increase the redshift identification completeness of the sample, we also included photometric redshifts from a catalogue built following the procedure described in Pannella et al. (2009b) and Strazzullo et al. (2010). The photometric redshifts (zphot) were estimated using a PSF-matched multi-wavelength catalogue including 10 photometric optical/near-IR passbands (from the U band to 4.5 μm), through a comparison with a library of galaxy SED templates, spanning a wide range of galaxy types (from elliptical, to star-forming to QSO-dominated) and star formation histories (SFHs). The construction of the multi-wavelength catalogue and the photometric redshift estimates will be described in detail in a paper by Pannella et al. (in prep.). The photometric redshift catalogue includes 1893 zphot within the GOODS-Herschel area considered here. Photometric redshift estimates were available for 671 of the 24 μm detected sources (~35%) without zspec measurements. To verify the reliability of the photometric redshifts we compared the zphot with the spectroscopic redshifts from Barger et al. (2008); in the photometric catalogue by Pannella et al. there are 1030 sources overlapping with the Barger et al. (2008) spectroscopic sample. The relative accuracy of zphot, defined as the average absolute scatter (AAS = mean [|Δz|/(1 + zspec)], where Δz = (zphot − zspec); e.g. Rafferty et al. 2011) is ≈5%, with ≈4% of outliers (AAS > 0.2; see also Mullaney et al. 2012). Two further zphot were taken from Pope et al. (2006), yielding a total of 673 photometric redshift estimates for our sample. This gives a final redshift identification completeness of ~98% (1900/1943 sources, including spectroscopic and photometric redshifts) amongst the 24 μm detected sources in the GOODS-Herschel field with a redshift range z = 0.02–6.54. For the purposes of our analysis, we want to investigate here only the sources with a significant radio detection, in order to have reliable measurements of the FIR-radio correlation. We therefore only included in our sample sources with a redshift identification amongst the VLA/24 μm sample (484/489 sources). Due to the limitations dictated by our SED fitting tool (Sect. 3.1), we also imposed a redshift limit of z ≤ 3.0 to our sources, yielding a sample of 458 VLA/24 μm sources with spectroscopic or photometric redshifts of z ≤ 3.0. The analysis of the whole 24 μm detected sample, including radio undetected sources, will be presented in a future paper (Del Moro et al., in prep.). 2.6. Stellar masses The multi-wavelength optical/near-IR catalogue used to estimate the photometric redshifts (Pannella et al., in prep.; see Sect. 2.5) was also used to calculate the galaxy stellar masses (M∗). The stellar masses have been derived using the SED fitting code detailed in Drory et al. (2004, 2009) to fit our multi-wavelength data. The star formation histories have been parameterised with a linear combination of a main SF event, with SFR exponentially declining with time as ψ(t) ∝ exp(− t/τ) (where the time-scale τ = 0.1–20 Gyr), and a secondary burst. The main component has solar metallicity and an age between 0.01 Gyr and the age of the Universe at the source redshift, while the secondary burst is limited to 10% of the galaxy total stellar mass and is modelled as a 100 Myr old constant SFR episode with solar metallicity. We adopted a Salpeter (1955) IMF for both components and an extinction law (Calzetti et al. 2000), allowing ranges of AV = 0–1.5 mag and AV = 0 − 2.0 mag to extinguish the main component and the burst, respectively (Pannella et al., in prep.; see also Mullaney et al. 2012). The uncertainties on the stellar masses are estimated from the dispersion on the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) distribution of the entire library of models adopted, as well as from the systematic uncertainties (due to the adopted models, IMF, SFH, metallicity, etc.; see e.g. Marchesini et al. 2009). The uncertainties are typically larger at low stellar masses and range from ≈0.4 dex at log M∗ = 9.0 M⊙ to ≈0.2 dex at log M∗ = 11.0 M⊙ (Pannella et al., in prep.). We note that also AGN emission in the UV/optical band can cause uncertainties on the stellar mass estimates. However, the contamination from the AGN affects the stellar mass only when the AGN is very luminous (LX > 1044 erg s-1; e.g. Mullaney et al. 2012; Rovilos Georgantopoulos 2007; Xue et al. 2010). Fig. 1 Galaxy stellar masses in units of M⊙ for the entire 24 μm detected sample with redshift identification (spectroscopic or photometric). The stellar masses for the sources detected in the VLA radio band are shown as grey histogram and the X-ray detected sources are shown as shaded black histogram. Stellar masses were measured for 1894 of the 1900 24 μm detected sources with a redshift identification within the GOODS-Herschel field (Sect. 2.5), which include 456 of the 458 VLA/24 μm sources with spectroscopic or photometric redshift z ≤ 3.0 that constitute our final sample. The galaxy stellar mass values obtained range between log M∗ = 7.0 − 12.5 M⊙ (log M∗ = 8.7 − 11.9 M⊙ for the VLA/24 μm sample), with the large majority of the sources (≈97%) having log M∗ = 9.0−11.5 M⊙ (Fig. 1)2. The median stellar mass for the 24 μm sample is log M∗ ≈ 10.4 M⊙, and for the VLA/24 μm sample the median is log M∗ ≈ 10.8 M⊙. We note that the stellar mass distribution of the VLA/24 μm sample sources is consistent with that of the X-ray detected sources (median stellar mass: log M∗ ≈ 10.9 M⊙; see Fig. 1). 3. FIR-radio correlation 3.1. SED fitting approach The emission observed in the MIR and FIR bands is produced by dust heated by the radiation emitted through star formation and/or accretion onto a SMBH. Star-formation, which occurs on large scales in galaxies, heats the dust to a wide range of temperatures: the hot dust produces emission at near-IR (NIR; λ ≈ 2.0−5.0 μm) and MIR wavelengths and gives rise to the characteristic PAH features (e.g. Chary Elbaz 2001; Smith et al. 2007), while a large amount of colder dust (Tdust ≈ 20−50 K; see also Sect. 1) produces a typical SED that peaks at FIR wavelengths (λ ~ 100 μm). AGN activity yields on average hotter dust temperatures (Tdust ≈ 200 − 1000 K) than star formation, so that the bulk of the AGN emission is produced in the MIR band with a peak at shorter wavelengths (λ ~ 20−30 μm; e.g. Mullaney et al. 2011; Netzer et al. 2007). The lack of colder dust (Tdust 200 K) causes a fast decline of the SED at wavelengths longer than λ ≳ 30 μm (e.g. Mullaney et al. 2011; Netzer et al. 2007). AGN activity and star formation are often coupled in a galaxy and it is not trivial to separate the emission due to these two processes. To disentangle the two components we therefore performed a detailed analysis of the IR SEDs of the 458 VLA/24 μm detected sources, with spectroscopic or photometric redshifts out to z = 3 (Sect. 2.5). To represent the galaxy emission we used five star-forming galaxy (SFG) templates defined by Mullaney et al. (2011), covering the wavelength range 6–1000 μm. These five templates are defined as composites of a sample of local star-forming galaxies with LIR ≲ 1012 L⊙ (Brandl et al. 2006) and are designed to sample the full range of IRAS colours observed for these galaxies (see Mullaney et al. 2011, for details). We have extended the five SFG templates to shorter wavelengths (3 μm) using the average starburst SED derived by Dale et al. (2001). To verify whether the Dale et al. (2001) template was suitable for extending the Mullaney et al. (2011) templates, we obtained publicly available NIR and MIR data (from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database, NED3) for the Brandl et al. (2006) sample of local star-forming galaxies and we plotted these data points over our extended templates as a check; we thus verified that data and models agreed with reasonable scatter. We also extended the five SFG templates to the radio band with a power-law slope Sν ∝ ν− α, with α = 0.7 (e.g., Ibar et al. 2009, 2010; see Fig. 2). The normalisation of the radio power-law component was fixed according to the typical FIR-radio relation found for local star-forming galaxies (Condon 1992; Helou et al. 1985). We stress that even though we limited our SFG template library to only 5 templates, they represent a wide range of IR color–color properties of star-forming galaxies (Mullaney et al. 2011), even broader than those reproduced by, e.g., the Chary Elbaz (2001) galaxy template library (105 templates; see Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Comparison of the five star-forming galaxy templates used in our approach (black lines) with the 105 Chary Elbaz (2001) galaxy templates (grey lines); all of the templates have been normalised to 1 at 30 μm. With our 5 SFG templates we cover a broad range of star-forming galaxy properties, even broader than those of the Chary Elbaz (2001) templates. To reproduce the emission from the AGN we used the empirically defined AGN template by Mullaney et al. (2011), composed by a broken power-law, declining at wavelengths longward of λ ≳ 30 μm as a modified black-body. We note that this template is in agreement with the typical SEDs produced by clumpy torus models (e.g. Nenkova et al. 2008a,b). We fixed the power-law indices at the average values Γ1 = 1.7 and Γ2 = 0.7, with a break point at λBrk = 19 μm (see Mullaney et al. 2011). We have allowed the AGN component to be modified due to dust extinction, using the extinction law of Draine (2003), which mainly affects the template at λ ≲ 30 μm and also produces the typical silicate absorption feature at 9.7 μm, often observed in AGN (e.g. Martínez-Sansigre et al. 2008; Roche et al. 1991, 2007; Shi et al. 2006). The flux densities at 8 μm, 16 μm, 24 μm from Spitzer and 100 μm, 160 μm and 250 μm from Herschel have been used in the SED fitting process to constrain the SEDs of our sources (Fig. 3). In the case of non-detections (S/N 3), the measured fluxes at each source positions, with the large associated uncertainties, were used in the SED fits. The fluxes in the shorter Spitzer-IRAC bands (3.6, 4.5, 5.8 μm) were not included in the SED fitting process as they fall out of the wavelength range covered by our templates at relatively low redshifts z > 0.2. Moreover, at these wavelengths the observed SED is often dominated by the old stellar population emission, which is not accounted for in our SED templates. Data at longer wavelengths from Herschel-SPIRE 350 μm and 500 μm (Elbaz et al. 2011) were also not included in the fits, because of the larger uncertainties on the measured fluxes due to strong blending (see Sect. 2.2) and the low number of significantly detected sources. However, these fluxes (or upper limits) have been included when plotting the SEDs, as a visual check of the best-fitting SED solutions (see Figs. 3 and B.1). We note that only using photometry at λ 250 μm (SPIRE-250 μm band) means that at high redshifts (z ≳ 1.3) we are not able to fully constrain the FIR SED peak at wavelengths longer than λ ≈ 100 μm (rest-frame) and therefore we cannot exclude the presence of a colder dust component, which would yield higher FIR fluxes than that predicted from our model. However we can anticipate (see Sect. 3.2) that we find very good agreement between our average FIR-radio relation and that found in several previous works. Fig. 3 Examples of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to demonstrate the variety of SEDs found for the radio-excess sources (Sect. 3.2). The SEDs on the left are consistent with a simple galaxy template: SFG template (“IR SFG”, top) or elliptical galaxy template (“passive”, bottom; see Sect. 4.3); the SFG template upper limit (grey line) is also shown. We note that the elliptical template (long dashed line) is not fitted to the data, but it is only shown to demonstrate that it can well represent the data. The SEDs on the right are fitted with a star-forming galaxy (dashed line) + AGN (dotted line) model (“IR AGN”): on the top there is an X-ray detected AGN, on the bottom an X-ray undetected AGN. The total SEDs are shown as black solid lines. The filled circles represent the Spitzer 8, 16, 24 μm and the Herschel 100, 160, 250 μm flux densities (in mJy), used to constrain the SEDs. The open symbols indicates the data that were not included in the SED fitting process: red triangles are Spitzer-IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 μm flux densities, black circles are SPIRE 350 and 500 μm and black squares are VLA 1.4 GHz flux densities; the radio data do not match the SEDs in these cases, because the sources have excess radio emission compared to that expected from pure star formation (Sect. 3.2). The blue star represents the 6 μm luminosity of the AGN predicted from the X-ray luminosity in the rest-frame 2–10 keV, using the Lutz et al. (2004) relation for local unobscured AGN; we note that this point does not match the IR AGN component because the X-ray luminosity tends to underestimate the intrinsic AGN power if the AGN emission is heavily absorbed (see Sect. 5.1). On the top left corner of each plot the source redshifts are indicated as well as the corresponding source number in Table 1 (Col. 1). The SED fitting process was developed as follows: 1. initially, only the star-forming galaxy templates were used in thefit; we fitted the data of each source with each of the five SFGtemplates (Fig. 2) using χ2 minimisation to evaluate the goodness of the fit; 2. as a second step, we performed new fits, again using χ2 minimisation, by adding the AGN component, also including extinction of the AGN component as a free parameter (varying between AV ≈ 0−30 mag, corresponding to NH ≈ 0−5 × 1022 cm-2 assuming the average galactic dust-to-gas ratio AV = NH/(1.8 × 1021); e.g. Predehl Schmitt 1995), to each SFG template (SFG + AGN); 3. finally, an f-test was performed using the χ2 values and the degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) for all of the five pairs of solutions to evaluate the improvement of the fit due to the addition of the AGN component. We accepted the SFG + AGN model as the best-fit if the AGN component significantly (i.e. >90% confidence level, according to the f-test probability) improved the resulting χ2 for the majority of the solutions, i.e. in at least three out of five fitting solutions. The criteria we adopted to define the best-fitting model were established after performing several tests on our SED fitting approach; in particular, we tested these criteria on a sub-sample of our sources for which detailed Spitzer-IRS MIR spectra are available (see Appendix A, for details). Fig. 4 Left: distribution of FIR-radio flux ratio (q) for all of the sources in the VLA/24 μm sample (458 sources, excluding the upper limits; see Sect. 3.2); the blue Gaussian profile represents the best fit to the peak (qmean = 2.21 ± 0.18), while the red dashed Gaussian is the q distribution found by Helou et al. (1985) for local starburst galaxies. The vertical line indicates the separation we assumed to select our radio-excess sources, q = 1.68, corresponding to 3σ from the peak (2σ when include radio upper limits). Right: FIR-radio flux ratio (q) as a function of redshift for all of the VLA/24 μm sources; the radio-excess sources have q 1.68 (dot-dashed line); the solid horizontal line represents the average q value for the “radio-normal” sources (q = 2.21) and the shaded region indicates the ± 1σ error from this average. The radio-excess sources identified by Donley et al. (2005) are plotted as crosses (see Sect. 3.3). The binned q average for the “radio-normal” sources, in three redshift bins, is also shown as black circles; we found no significant evidence of evolution of the FIR-radio correlation out to z = 3. Once the best-fit model was defined, the final measurements of the properties of the sources (i.e., FIR flux, relative AGN/SFG contribution, etc.) and their errors were derived as weighted averages of the values obtained from the five best-fit model solutions (see Appendix A for details). For the AGN + SFG models we included in the average only the solutions where the AGN component was significant (>90% confidence level). This is because, due to the sparse data used to constrain the SEDs, in some cases the five solutions obtained from the different SFG templates were similar (small difference in χ2 values) and did not allow us to unambiguously determine a unique solution that best characterised the data (see Appendix A, for details). 3.2. Radio-excess sample selection The FIR-radio correlation is typically defined as the ratio between the flux in the FIR band (~40−120 μm; rest-frame) and the flux density in the rest-frame radio band (1.4 GHz; e.g. Helou et al. 1985; Sargent et al. 2010a). Many studies performed so far at high redshift relied on either MIR fluxes as a “proxy” for the FIR (or bolometric IR) flux (e.g. from the S24 μm; Appleton et al. 2004; Donley et al. 2005), 70 μm flux density (e.g. Appleton et al. 2004; Bourne et al. 2011; Sargent et al. 2010a; Seymour et al. 2009), or on SED fitting spanning only the rest-frame MIR band (e.g. Padovani et al. 2011; Sargent et al. 2010a). These methods are often inaccurate because they require assumptions about the source SED over the whole IR band and/or on the bolometric corrections. Through our detailed SED analysis of the 458 VLA/24 μm sources with z ≤ 3.0, using the approach described in the previous section (Sect. 3.1) and the Herschel data to constrain the FIR SED peak, we can overcome these issues by directly measuring the galaxy emission over the whole IR band. From the best-fit models, we calculated the FIR flux (fFIR) by directly integrating the total SEDs over the rest-frame wavelength range λ = 42.5−122.5 μm (e.g. Helou et al. 1985). We used the total SED, which in many cases includes contributions from both SFG and AGN components, to calculate the FIR flux because we aim at a conservative selection of radio-excess AGN, since radio quiet AGN often follow the typical FIR-radio relation of star-forming galaxies. In only ≈3% of the 458 analysed sources (15 sources) was the SED fitting analysis unable to provide a good representation of the mid- and far-IR data4. In most of the cases (6/15), this was due to large uncertainties on the photometric redshift, or possibly to spurious counterpart associations between the different catalogues (see Sect. 2.5). In a smaller number of cases (4/15), the poor fitting results seemed to be due to large uncertainties on the flux density measurements, especially at wavelengths where the sources are not significantly detected (S/N 3). We flagged these “problematic” cases in Table 1 (column “Fit”), being aware that the measurements obtained from their SEDs are not fully reliable. The remainder of these sources (5/15) have strong emission in the Spitzer IRAC bands, even stronger than the flux detected at 24 μm (S8/S24 > 1), and are not detected at longer wavelengths (FIR) by Herschel. This suggests that the emission from star formation (or AGN) in these sources is weak, while the emission from old stellar population, usually dominating the rest-frame NIR band (λ 5 μm, rest-frame), is strong; their infrared SEDs are therefore more consistent with that of galaxies dominated by passive stellar populations rather than by active star formation. For these sources FIR flux upper limits were estimated by normalising the SFG templates to the 24 μm datapoint (Figs. 3 and B.1), which is thus used as a proxy of star formation, and integrating the SED between 42.5 − 122.5 μm. Of the five measurements obtained from the different SFG templates, the maximum has been taken as the fFIR upper limit. Using the definition given by Helou et al. (1985), we calculated the ratio between the far-infrared and radio emission (q) as: (1)\\begin{equation} q=\\log \\left[f_{\\rm FIR}/\\left(3.75\\times10^{12}{\\rm\\ Hz}\\right) \\right]-\\log\\ [S_{\\nu} (1.4\\rm\\ GHz)] \\end{equation}q=log[fFIR/(3.75×1012Hz)]−log[Sν(1.4GHz)]where fFIR is in units of W m-2, 3.75 × 1012 Hz is the frequency at the centre of the FIR band (λ = 80 μm) and Sν(1.4 GHz) is the radio flux density (in units of W m-2 Hz-1) at rest-frame 1.4 GHz, extrapolated from the VLA data using the power-law slope Sν ∝ ν−α, with α = 0.7, typical for star-forming galaxies (e.g., Ibar et al. 2009, 2010). The q distribution obtained for the entire sample is shown in Fig. 4 (left); the sources where fFIR (and therefore also q) is an upper limit are not included in the histogram. The peak of the distribution is at q ≈ 2.2, in excellent agreement with the values typically obtained for star-forming/starburst galaxies (e.g. Condon 1992; Helou et al. 1985). However, the distribution is not symmetrical around the peak and shows a broad tail at low q values, indicating a relatively large number of sources with excess radio emission over that expected from star formation processes. In order to identify the radio-excess sources, we fitted the peak of the q distribution, considering only sources with q > 2.0, with a Gaussian profile and estimated the spread of the FIR-radio correlation expected for star-forming galaxies: from the best-fit we obtained q = 2.21 ± 0.18 (see Fig. 4). If we also include the radio undetected sources (S/N 3) in the q distribution, we obtain a Gaussian profile with a very similar peak, but larger scatter (q = 2.24 ± 0.29), due to the larger uncertainties on the q values. The q values for the radio undetected sources were calculated using the radio 1.4 GHz flux measurements at the 24 μm source positions (Sect. 2.3). We set the separation between “radio-normal” and “radio-excess” sources at q = 1.68, corresponding to a 3σ deviation from the peak of the distribution for the VLA/24 μm sample (~2σ from the peak for the whole 24 μm sample). We defined “radio-normal” as the sources with q > 1.68, that follow the typical FIR-radio relation (q ≈ 2.2); we note that this population includes star-forming galaxies, but also typical radio-quiet AGN (e.g. Morić et al. 2010; Padovani et al. 2011; Sargent et al. 2010a), while the large majority of the radio-excess sources are most likely to host AGN activity. With our selection we obtained a sample of 51 radio-excess AGN candidates, ~11% of the whole VLA/24 μm detected sample at z ≤ 3.0. In Fig. 4 (right) we show the FIR-radio ratio (q) for the entire sample as a function of redshift. The horizontal dashed line indicates the q value at the peak of the distribution (q = 2.21 ± 0.18) with 1σ uncertainty (shaded region), while the dot-dashed line at q = 1.68 represents our threshold for radio-excess sources (3σ deviation from the peak). In the plot we also marked 12 of the Donley et al. (2005) radio-excess sources that are found within the GOODS-Herschel (North) field and overlap with our sample5 (see Sect. 3.3). In Fig. 4 (right) we also show that the average q for all of the radio-normal sources, calculated in three different redshift bins (z1 = 0.0−1.0, z2 = 1.0−2.0, z3 = 2.0−3.0, black circles), remains fairly constant, within the errors, over the whole redshift range, and therefore, the apparent decrease of the q values at high redshift is not significant (e.g. Bourne et al. 2011; Elbaz et al. 2002; Mao et al. 2011; Sargent et al. 2010b). 3.3. IR-radio relation: q24 and q100 Several previous works that have investigated the FIR-radio correlation and radio-excess sources have used different methods to define the FIR-radio flux ratio. In particular, in many studies the FIR flux has been replaced by the monochromatic flux density at 24 μm (e.g. Appleton et al. 2004; Donley et al. 2005; Ibar et al. 2008; Sargent et al. 2010a), 60 μm (e.g. Vlahakis et al. 2007), or 70 μm (Mao et al. 2011; Sargent et al. 2010a; Seymour et al. 2009), as a proxy for the FIR emission of the galaxy. It is therefore interesting to see how these definitions of the FIR-radio ratios, calculated from monochromatic flux densities, compare to q estimated by us (Eq. (1)) across the full FIR waveband. In particular we performed a direct comparison of our sample selection with that used by Donley et al. (2005), where the radio-excess sources were selected using q24 0, with q24 = log (S24 μm/S1.4 GHz), calculated using the observed 24 μm and 1.4 GHz flux densities. As shown in Fig. 4 (right), the majority of the Donley et al. (2005) sources (11/12 that overlap with our sample) are also radio-excess sources based on our definition. However q24 does not provide a complete selection, since the majority of our radio-excess sources (≈78%, 40 objects) are missing from the Donley et al. (2005) sample. To verify that this is not only due to the improved sensitivity of our radio data (Sect. 2.3), we compared the number of radio-excess sources we would identify with our q definition and selection (q 1.68) using the radio catalogue by Richards (2000), the same as that used by Donley et al. (2005): we obtained 24 radio-excess sources in the GOODS-Herschel field, twice the number of those identified by Donley et al. (2005) using q24 within the same sky area (12 sources). Moreover, in one case the q24 selection by Donley et al. (2005) disagrees with our FIR-radio ratio, underestimating the FIR power of the sources (Fig. 4, right). This effect is shown more clearly in Fig. 5, where we calculated the observed q24 and q100 for all of the VLA/24 μm detected sources6. The q24 and q100 ratios predicted for our range of star-forming galaxies are shown as shaded regions in Fig. 5, where our radio-excess sources (q 1.68) are marked with open circles; the q24 = 0 line adopted by Donley et al. (2005) to select radio-excess sources is also shown (Fig. 5, top panel). Although the q24 0 criterion would select some of our radio-excess sources, more than 60% of them would be missed, testifying the large incompleteness of this method when compared to the FIR-radio relation q (Eq. (1)). Moreover, using q24 0 to define the radio-excess sample would include some “radio-normal” galaxies (according to our definition; Sect 3.2), introducing some contamination to the sample (~10%). Fig. 5 Infrared-to-radio flux ratios, using the observed 24 μm (q24; top) and 100 μm flux densities (q100; bottom); the radio-excess sources in our sample (q 1.68) are highlighted by open circles. The shaded regions in the two plots represent the q24 and q100 ratios predicted for our range of star-forming galaxies as a function of redshift. The horizontal line in the top plot is the q24 = 0 selection used by Donley et al. (2005) to define their radio-excess sample. In the bottom panel we identified q100 = 1.5 as an easy selection of radio-excess sources (dashed line), with reasonable completeness (≈60–80%) at least out to z ≈ 2. On the other hand, the q100 ratio (Fig. 5, bottom) seems to be in better agreement with our q selection than the q24 ratio, as few of our radio-excess sources fall into the shaded area. This is expected since the flux observed at 100 μm is closer to the FIR SED peak than that observed at 24 μm which is also likely to be affected by the PAH emission features at z ≳ 1 (as illustrated by the shaded region in Fig. 5, top) and/or by AGN contribution. By defining a separation line below the shaded area to identify radio-excess sources (e.g. q100 = 1.5; Fig. 5) we would recover the majority of our radio-excess sources (~60%; ~80% including the upper limits that lie right above the separation line), a much larger fraction than those identified using q24. We stress, however, that the q100 (observed) selection is still not complete and much less accurate than our selection method using the rest-frame FIR flux to calculate q. Fig. 6 Top panel: fraction of radio-excess sources as a function of the rest-frame FIR luminosity (42.5–122.5 μm, in units of L⊙); the fraction decreases with increasing LFIR, as expected since sources with high LFIR are more likely to be luminous star-forming galaxies. Bottom panel: rest-frame FIR vs. radio 1.4 GHz luminosity (rest-frame); the radio-excess sources are plotted as red circles and some local well known Compton-thick AGNs (open squares) are shown for comparison (data taken from literature). The black dotted line correspond to ⟨ qRL⟩ = −0.38 (average for a sample of RL AGN from Evans et al. 2005); the black solid line correspond to q = 2.21 (average for “radio-normal” sources) and the red dashed line correspond to q = 1.68, our selection limit for radio-excess sources. 4. Results 4.1. Sample properties We established in Sect. 3 that the direct measurement of the FIR flux from the best-fit SED provides a reliable and unambiguous way to identify sources that have radio emission in excess to that expected purely from star formation. As described in the previous sections, from our analysis we identified 51 radio-excess sources, which are most likely hosting an AGN. In Fig. 6, we show the rest-frame FIR and the radio 1.4 GHz luminosities (LFIR − L1.4 GHz; rest-frame) for all of the “radio-normal” (black crosses) and the radio-excess sources (red circles) in the GOODS-Herschel field. The diagonal lines represent the mean q value obtained for the “radio-normal” sources (q = 2.21) and the separation between “radio-normal” and radio-excess sources (q = 1.68). For comparison we also indicate in the plot the average q obtained for a sample of low-redshift (z ≲ 0.15) radio-loud AGN (RL; ⟨ qRL⟩ = −0.38) from Evans et al. (2005). For these sources the FIR flux was calculated using the photometry at 60 μm and 100 μm, following Helou et al. (1985). Some well studied local Compton-thick AGN taken from literature7 (Della Ceca et al. 2008) are also plotted, as a guide; although the majority of these sources have FIR-radio ratios consistent with that of star-forming galaxies and most radio-quiet AGN (q ≈ 2.2), three out of the eight AGN are radio-excess sources (i.e., Mkn 3, NGC 7674 and NGC 1068), suggesting that some Compton-thick AGN might also be included in our radio-excess sample. It is important to note that, although some of our radio-excess sources have radio luminosities typical of radio-loud AGN (Lrad > 1024 W Hz-1), the majority lies in a region in between those occupied by RL AGN and “radio-normal” sources and therefore can also be referred to as “radio-intermediate” sources (e.g. Drake et al. 2003). We therefore stress that the definition of “radio-excess” does not necessarily mean “radio-loud” (see Sect. 1). In the top panel of Fig. 6, the fraction of radio-excess sources as a function of the rest-frame FIR luminosity is shown (with 1σ uncertainties; Gehrels 1986). The sources in our sample span a wide range of FIR luminosities, LFIR ≈ 109 − 1012 L⊙ (Table 3), typical of normal star-forming galaxies, luminous IR galaxies (LIRG; LFIR ≈ 1011 L⊙) and ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs; LFIR ≈ 1012 L⊙). However, the fraction of radio-excess sources decreases with increasing FIR luminosity, and only one source out of 51 reaches the high luminosities typical of ULIRGs. This is not unexpected, since at the high FIR luminosities of ULIRGs, the radio core must be very bright (Lrad > 2 × 1024 W Hz-1; RL AGN regime) to be identified as radio-excess above the very strong star-formation activity. 4.2. X-ray and radio emission from the AGN Since the excess radio emission is attributed to the presence of an AGN, it is interesting to investigate the X-ray properties of these sources. Amongst our radio-excess AGN sample, only ~53% (27/51) are detected in the X-ray band (Table 1), hence about half of the sample is X-ray undetected. This suggests that the radio-excess selection is a powerful method to identify AGN that would otherwise be missed by even the deepest X-ray AGN surveys, such as the Chandra 2 Ms X-ray survey (Alexander et al. 2003). In Fig. 7, we show the fraction of radio-excess sources as a function of X-ray luminosity. The sources have been divided into five X-ray luminosity bins from L2 − 10 keV = 1040 erg s-1 to L2 − 10 keV = 1045 erg s-1. We found that the fraction of radio-excess AGN increases from ≈7% at low X-ray luminosities (L2 − 10 keV 1042 erg s-1) to ≈60% in the highest luminosity bin (L2 − 10 keV = 1044 − 1045 erg s-1). This large increase of radio-excess AGN at high luminosities suggests that the brightest AGN also produce the most powerful radio emission (e.g. Brinkmann et al. 2000; La Franca et al. 2010), presumably the majority of it coming from a radio core. We note that the fact that more luminous AGN are also more radio bright does not mean that high luminosity AGN are typically radio loud. On the contrary, the radio-loudness, measured as RX = log (νL1.4 GHz/L2 − 10 keV), decreases with increasing X-ray luminosity (e.g. La Franca et al. 2010). To investigate in detail the radio properties of our radio-excess sources we compared the excess radio emission (i.e. the excess above the radio emission expected from star formation), with the AGN radio core emission detected in deep VLBI 1.4 GHz observations of the Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N) and the Hubble Flanking Fields (HFF). The details of the VLBI observations are given in Chi et al. (2009) and Chi et al. (in prep.). Briefly, the sensitivity of the VLBI data varies significantly from the centre of the field (rms noise level of 7.3 μJy/beam within 2′ from the phase centre) to the outer parts of the field (2′ − 8′; rms noise level of 14–37 μJy/beam), which means that only sources with a radio core brighter than S1.4 GHz ≳ 100 μJy are likely to be detected. Amongst our radio-excess sample, only 13 sources are bright enough (on the basis of the VLA 1.4 GHz flux density; Table 3) to be detected in the VLBI images and for eight of them a compact radio core was indeed detected by VLBI, positively confirming that these sources host an AGN and that the excess radio emission is in fact due to a radio core. The remaining five sources have on average lower radio VLA fluxes compared to the sources detected by VLBI (the only exception is #47, in Table 3, which is an extended radio-loud, wide-angle-tailed source) and lie in the outer regions of the VLBI field; the non-detection therefore might be due to sensitivity issues, or, as in the case of source #47, to the radio flux being dominated by extended emission, more than a compact core. The rest of our radio-excess sources lie outside the VLBI region (13 sources) or are typically too faint (S1.4 GHz 100 μJy) to be significantly detected above the VLBI sensitivity limit (25 sources). Fig. 7 Fraction of radio-excess sources in different X-ray luminosity bins; the fraction of sources with excess radio emission increases with X-ray luminosity, from ≈7% at LX = 1040 − 1041 erg s-1 to ≈60% at LX = 1044 − 1045 erg s-1. The error bars correspond to 1σ uncertainties (Gehrels 1986). The dashed histogram represents the radio-excess fraction including the X-ray upper limits (Sect. 2.4). In Fig. 8 we show the comparison between the AGN radio core emission measured from the VLBI data and the excess radio emission obtained for our sources. The excess radio emission was estimated by subtracting the 1.4 GHz flux predicted for star formation assuming the average value q = 2.21 (Sect. 3.2), from the total radio flux density (from the VLA data at 1.4 GHz; Sect. 2.3). The obtained radio excess flux densities agree with the VLBI AGN core emission within a factor of ≈2. This is a further validation that our SED analysis is reliable and that with it we are able to predict the AGN radio-core luminosities with reasonable accuracy. We note that our estimates tend to slightly over predict the AGN radio-core flux densities because they might include contributions from extended radio emission, such as compact lobes, or “aborted jets” (e.g. Ghisellini et al. 2004), which are invisible for the high resolution VLBI. 4.3. SEDs of the radio-excess AGN From the SED fitting analysis we found that the infrared SEDs of the radio-excess sources are rather varied. A significant AGN component, which typically dominates the emission below ~40 μm (MIR), has been detected in ~45% of the radio-excess sources (23/51; hereafter, IR AGN; see Fig. B.1); this fraction is much higher than that found for the “radio-normal” population (~8%; Del Moro et al., in prep.), in line with the fact that radio-excess sources are AGNs, as opposed to “radio-normal” sources, which are a mix of radio-quiet AGN and star-forming galaxies (Sect. 3.2). The average FIR-radio ratio for the IR AGN amongst the radio-excess sources is ⟨ q⟩IR AGN = 1.02 ± 0.11, significantly lower than our threshold adopted to separate radio-excess from radio-normal sources (q 1.68). The remainder of the sample, however, do not require a significant AGN component in the SED fitting: ≈45% (23 out of 51 sources; Table 2) have SEDs consistent with those of star-forming galaxies (hereafter, IR SFGs; see Table 3 and Fig. B.1) and the remaining ~10% (5 out of 51) have IR SEDs not compatible with either star formation or AGN activity (see Sect. 3.2). For the latter group of sources we verified that the IR data are better represented by a normal elliptical galaxy template (generated with the GRASIL code; Silva et al. 1998), suggesting that these sources might be “passive” (not star-forming) galaxies (see Fig. B.1). The mean q value for the IR SFGs is ⟨ q⟩IR SFG = 1.33 ± 0.09, larger than the average obtained for the IR AGN, but still well below the radio-excess selection limit (q 1.68). For the “passive” sources, the FIR-radio ratio calculated from the SEDs are all upper limits and therefore we cannot provide a reliable average q value. In the far-infrared band, above λ ≈ 40 μm, the emission is dominated by star formation peaking around 100 μm (rest-frame) for the majority of the radio-excess sources (≈86%; 44 sources); this fraction also includes the majority of the sources that are dominated by AGN emission at shorter wavelength (i.e., IR AGN). However, we found a number of sources (≈14%; 7 sources) where the AGN emission outshines the star formation over the whole IR band, with the SFG contributing less than 50% to the total FIR luminosity; these sources are amongst the brightest AGN in our radio-excess sample and the majority of them (6/7) are also detected in X-rays. Constraining the actual contribution from star formation (if there is any) to the total SED in these objects would require deep sub-mm observations, in order to sample the wavelengths beyond the rest-frame 100 μm. Fig. 8 Radio core flux density at 1.4 GHz measured from the VLBI data (Chi et al., in prep.) vs. the excess radio emission (i.e., S1.4 GHz, tot − S1.4 GHz, SFG) for our radio-excess sources. Our radio fluxes agree with the VLBI measurements within a factor ≈2; our fluxes are typically higher because they might include some extended radio emission from outflows, or “aborted jets” (e.g. Ghisellini et al. 2004). Table 2 Summary of the IR and X-ray properties of the radio-excess sources. Class Total % X-ray detected % X-ray undetected % ⟨ q ⟩ ⟨ SFR ⟩ (M⊙ yr-1) Radio excess 51 100% 27 53% 24 47% 1.10 ± 0.08 58.8 ± 13.8 IR AGN 23 45% 18 78% 5 22% 1.02 ± 0.11 45.5 ± 14.4 IR SFG 23 45% 7 30% 16 70% 1.33 ± 0.09 69.2 ± 21.7 Passive 5 10% 2 40% 3 60% ... ... Using the broad-band IR luminosities (λ = 8−1000 μm, rest-frame) of the star formation component (i.e. removing the AGN contamination) derived from the best-fit SEDs in the same way as for the FIR luminosities (Sect. 3.2), we estimated the star formation rates (SFRs) for our radio-excess sources. To convert the IR luminosity (LIR) into SFR we used the relation from Kennicutt (1998), assuming a Salpeter (1955) IMF. The SFRs obtained for our sample span a wide range of values, from SFR ≈ 0.8 M⊙ yr-1, indicating very low star formation, to SFR ≈ 350 M⊙ yr-1, typical of starbursting systems. The average star formation rate of our radio-excess sources is ⟨ SFR⟩ = 58.8 ± 13.8, with the IR SFG having slightly higher values than the IR AGN (⟨ SFR⟩IR SFG = 69.2 ± 21.7 and ⟨ SFR⟩IR AGN = 45.5 ± 14.4; Table 2). We note that the SFR could not be calculated for four of the IR AGN where the AGN component significantly dominates the total IR SED (>90% contribution; i.e. #8, #13, #20 and #21, see Fig. B.1) and therefore the star formation component was not constrained from the SED fitting. Moreover, the “passive” sources have not been included in the SFR average for the radio-excess, since the SFRs estimated for these sources are upper limits. We stress that in our calculation of the SFRs we removed any contribution from the AGN to the IR luminosity, thanks to our SED decomposition. It is important to note that if we did not acknowledge the fact that AGN can contribute significantly also in the FIR band, and therefore assume that the total IR luminosity is only due to star formation (see e.g., Elbaz et al. 2010; Mullaney et al. 2012; Santini et al. 2012; Shao et al. 2010), we would over predict the SFR up to a factor of ~2 when the AGN emission contributes 50% to the total SED, and up to a factor of ~4, when the AGN dominates (>50% contribution) the SED at FIR wavelengths. 5. Discussion We have shown in the previous sections that through detailed SED analysis in the IR band using deep Spitzer and Herschel data we were able to identify a relatively large fraction of radio-excess AGN from an initial radio-IR selected sample in the GOODS-North field. Although the excess radio emission is attributed to an AGN, we found that the multi-wavelength properties of these sources are rather heterogeneous; from the results obtained for the radio-excess source SEDs (Sect. 4.3), we can distinguish three main types of objects amongst our sample: i) infrared AGN, ii) infrared star-forming galaxies (IR SFGs) and iii) “passive” systems. We aim here to explore in detail the variety of sources that compose the radio-excess population and whether the radio-excess AGN are different from the general X-ray selected AGN population. 5.1. Infrared AGN About 45% of our radio-excess sample is made of sources that we can define as “typical AGN”: these sources show a clear AGN component at IR wavelengths, which contributes more than 50% to the total emission in the MIR band, and are generally also detected in the X-rays (≈78%; Table 2): they are typically X-ray bright AGN, with luminosity above LX ≳ 1043 erg s-1. In Fig. 9 (top panel) we show the fraction of IR detected AGN at different X-ray luminosity bins. Although the number of sources in each bin is relatively small, it is evident that the fraction of AGN detected at IR wavelengths decreases with decreasing luminosity of the sources. While at LX > 1043 erg s-1 we are able to identify almost all of the X-ray detected AGN (>90%) through the IR SED analysis, at lower X-ray luminosities (LX = 1042 − 1043 erg s-1) this fraction drops to ≈50%. This means that when the AGN is intrinsically bright its emission is strong enough to outshine that of the host galaxy and it can be clearly detected at IR wavelengths (at least in the MIR band); for the brightest sources the AGN dominates the whole IR band, even at far-infrared wavelengths (e.g. #8 and #13, see Fig. B.1; Sect. 4.3). Fig. 9 Fraction of IR detected AGN as a function of the X-ray luminosity (top panel); the sources have been divided in five luminosity bins, between LX = 1040−1045 erg s-1, although no AGN is expected to be found below LX = 1041 erg s-1. The bottom panel shows the X-ray luminosity at 2–10 keV (rest-frame; not corrected for absorption) vs. the monochromatic 6 μm AGN luminosity (νLν) for the radio-excess sources. Some local Compton-thick AGN are also plotted as open squares (thin marks: observed LX; thick marks: absorption corrected LX). The shaded region represents the typical L6 μm − LX relation for local AGN (Lutz et al. 2004), while the dashed line is the relation expected for heavily obscured AGN (NH ≈ 1024 cm-2) and the dash-dotted line is the typical relation for starburst galaxies (taken from Alexander et al. 2008). From the best-fit SEDs we can calculate the MIR luminosity at λ = 6 μm for the AGN (extracted from the detected AGN component only), which is often used as a diagnostic for the intrinsic power of the AGN (e.g. Alexander et al. 2008; Gandhi et al. 2009; Georgantopoulos et al. 2011; Lutz et al. 2004), since the IR band is only lightly affected by extinction. In Fig. 9 (bottom panel) we plot the monochromatic 6 μm luminosity (L6 μm) of the AGN, derived from the SED fits, as a function of the X-ray luminosity (2–10 keV, rest-frame; not corrected for absorption). Where the AGN component was not significantly detected in the IR band, an upper limit was calculated for L6 μm to be 30% of the total (AGN + SFG) 6 μm luminosity estimated from the best-fit SEDs (Table 3; see Appendix A for justification). The shaded area in the figure represents the typical X-ray/IR luminosity correlation found for local, unobscured AGN by Lutz et al. (2004), while the dashed line represents the L6 μm–LX relation predicted for sources obscured by large column densities (NH ≈ 1024 cm-2; Alexander et al. 2008). When sources are heavily obscured (e.g., Compton thick), their X-ray luminosity can be strongly suppressed, as opposed to the IR luminosity, and they should lie on the left hand side of the local AGN relation (or even on the left of the dashed line). Indeed, for comparison, we also show in the figure some local Compton-thick AGN, with observed (thin open squares) and intrinsic (i.e., corrected for absorption; thick open squares) X-ray luminosities, taken from literature (NED3). Since for these local CT AGN we did not perform SED decomposition, we plotted the total 6 μm luminosity8 for these sources (obtained from Spitzer or ISO data, taken from literature). About 59% of our radio-excess AGN (19 out of 32 sources9 plotted in Fig. 9, bottom) follow the local L6 μm–LX relation from Lutz et al. (2004), indicating good agreement between the X-ray luminosity and the MIR luminosity estimated from our SEDs; the remaining X-ray detected AGN (8 sources) lie closer to the region expected for heavily obscured AGN (NH ≈ 1024 cm-2; see Alexander et al. 2008), together with all the X-ray undetected sources (5 sources), for which we have X-ray luminosity upper limits. The MIR luminosity of these objects indicates that the intrinsic power of the AGN is higher than that detected in the X-rays, suggesting they may be heavily obscured, possibly by Compton-thick material surrounding the black hole (NH > 1024 cm-2). Also for the X-ray undetected IR AGN (~22%, 5/23 sources; see Table 2) the IR luminosity measured from the SEDs (νL6 μm > 1043 erg s-1) implies that these sources should be bright enough in the X-rays to be detected by the deep Chandra data available in GOODS-N. Since our capability to detect the AGN emission in the IR decreases with decreasing AGN power (Fig. 9, top), this suggests that the five IR AGN that are X-ray undetected are likely to be intrinsically luminous sources, and therefore they are candidate Compton-thick AGN. On the basis of these analyses, amongst the IR detected AGN we can therefore estimate the fraction of candidate Compton-thick AGN to be up to ~43% (10 sources that lie close to the NH ≈ 1024 cm-2 line in Fig. 9, bottom), considering both X-ray detected and undetected AGN. However, to confirm the classification of these AGN as Compton-thick and their fraction, other diagnostics are necessary (e.g. Georgantopoulos et al. 2011; Goulding et al. 2011). The most efficient way to unambiguously classify these sources as Compton-thick AGN, would be the detection of a strong iron line (Fe Kα, E = 6.4 keV) and a reflection dominated spectrum from detailed X-ray spectral analysis. Unfortunately, since our sources are at high redshifts, they are typically weakly detected (or undetected) in the deep Chandra data, preventing the good quality spectra necessary for this kind of analysis. 5.2. Infrared star-forming galaxies Together with the IR AGN, the other main group amongst our radio-excess sources (≈45%) have IR SEDs consistent with star formation emission, with no significant evidence at IR wavelengths for the presence of an AGN. However, the excess radio emission still suggests that these sources are not simple star-forming galaxies. Miller Owen (2001) found a significant number of star-forming galaxies not hosting AGN (~20%) with enhanced radio emission compared to the typical FIR-radio relation. However this phenomenon has been observed in the centre of galaxy clusters and the radio excess for these galaxies has been estimated to be not larger than a factor of three from the field galaxy FIR-radio relation (corresponding to q ≈ 1.73; Gavazzi Jaffe 1986). Bressan et al. (2002) interpret this effect as a post starburst phase, when the star formation has stopped, while the radio emission produced by supernova remnants (SNRs) has still not dimmed, as it fades more slowly. This phenomenon can not explain the origin of the radio excess in all of our IR SFGs, since the selection criteria adopted in our analysis (q 1.68), which correspond to more than a factor three enhancement of the radio emission, should already exclude the majority of these radio-excess post-starburst galaxies; moreover, it is unlikely that about half of our radio-excess sources reside in the centre of galaxy clusters. In fact, the average q calculated for our IR SFG (⟨ q⟩IR SFG = 1.33; see Sect. 4.3) suggests that the radio emission in these sources is much higher than that observed in post-starburst galaxies. Moreover, we verified that the SFR for the IR SFGs is consistent with that of star-forming/starburst galaxies (Sect. 4.3), meaning that the star formation is still ongoing in these systems. Therefore, the excess radio emission in these IR SFG can only be due to the presence on an AGN. A number of the IR SFGs (7/23) are detected in the X-ray band, although they are typically less luminous than the X-ray detected IR AGN (LX ≲ 1043 erg s-1). For these sources we estimated the IR luminosity expected for the AGN at 6 μm from the X-ray luminosity in the 2–10 keV band (rest-frame) using the Lutz et al. (2004) relation for local unobscured AGN. In four cases, the estimated L6 μm of the AGN is consistent with the total 6 μm luminosity calculated from the SEDs (see Fig. 9), indicating that the MIR emission of these sources is unlikely to be produced by star formation only, despite our SED fits suggest that this is the case. The AGN in these sources might be obscured at MIR wavelengths (e.g. Deo et al. 2009; Goulding Alexander 2009; Goulding et al. 2012) and therefore the emission appears dominated by star formation. These IR SFGs are the brightest sources amongst this group10 (LX ≈ 1043 erg s-1) and indeed their SEDs could be consistent with a combination of SFG + AGN emission; however, given our conservative criteria to identify the best-fitting SED model, the AGN component in these cases did not pass the f-test probability threshold (see Appendix A). At the luminosities of these sources, the SED fitting procedure struggles to disentangle the two components, especially if the AGN contribution is not significantly larger than that from star formation (Fig. 9, top, and Appendix A). For the other three sources, both the X-ray and the predicted IR luminosities are below LX ≲ 1042 erg s-1 (see Table 3), which are consistent both with a faint AGN or with star-forming galaxy emission. The remaining ≈70% of the IR SFGs (16/23) are not detected in the X-ray band. The most likely interpretation for these IR SFGs amongst our radio-excess sources is that they are low–moderate luminosity AGN, typically with LX ≲ 1043 erg s-1 (see Fig. 9), or possibly luminous AGN heavily obscured at MIR wavelengths, and hosted in dusty star-forming galaxies, whose IR emission is thus overwhelmed by star formation and eludes our detection capability (Sect. 5.1). If a large amount of dust is present in these galaxies, the nuclear emission from the AGN could be heavily obscured and remain undetected even in the X-rays. Supporting this interpretation is the fact that one of our X-ray undetected IR SFGs (#29, in Table 3) was found to have a compact radio core in the VLBI observations by Chi et al. (2009), clearly revealing the presence of an AGN in this star-forming galaxy (see Sect. 4.2); this source also shows extremely red optical/NIR colours, indicating significant dust reddening (Chi et al. 2009). Although the inability to unambiguously identify the presence of an AGN in the IR and/or X-ray bands for the majority of these IR SFGs represents an evident limitation in finding AGN, the radio excess provides a clear signal, often the only signal, of nuclear activity in these sources, bringing us closer to completing the census of the AGN population. 5.3. “Passive” systems A small fraction (≈10%, 5/51 objects) of the radio-excess sources seem to have weak contributions from AGN activity and star formation, as their IR SEDs are in fact consistent with those of relatively quiescent elliptical galaxies (Sect. 4.3). These sources have lower redshifts (z ≤ 1, except for one with z ~ 1.5) than the average of the radio-excess sample and some of them are amongst the most powerful radio emitters (Table 1). This suggests that they might be radio galaxies, such as Fanaroff-Riley type I radio galaxies (FR Is), which are powered by low accretion rate AGNs (Chiaberge et al. 1999; Ghisellini Celotti 2001). At low accretion rates (L/LEdd 0.01) AGNs are predicted to have radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs; Narayan McClintock 2008; Narayan et al. 1995), which are typically associated with strong radio outflows (Maccarone et al. 2003; Narayan et al. 1995). Indeed, one of the passive sources in our sample (#47 in Table 3) is a well known wide-angle-tail (WAT) radio source at z = 1.265 and shows strong extended radio jets (e.g., Bauer et al. 2002). These galaxies may have already passed the active phase when the SMBH is rapidly growing and the host galaxy experiences strong star formation and they are left with a low accreting SMBH in a passive red galaxy (e.g. Hickox et al. 2009; Hopkins et al. 2006a). 5.4. Radio excess or dimmed star formation? In this subsection we aim to investigate the properties of the galaxies hosting the radio-excess AGN, comparing them to the properties of X-ray selected AGN hosts. In Sect. 4.3 we have shown that the radio-excess sources have on average star formation rates typical of normal star-forming/starburst galaxies. However, to have better insights into the host galaxy properties one should explore the specific star formation rate (sSFR), i.e. the SFR per unit stellar mass. In fact, recent studies have shown that a correlation exists between the SFR and the galaxy stellar mass (e.g. Daddi et al. 2007; Elbaz et al. 2007; Noeske et al. 2007; Pannella et al. 2009a), meaning that more massive galaxies have typically higher SFRs. This correlation also evolves with redshift, producing the so called “main sequence” of star-forming galaxies (MS; e.g., Elbaz et al. 2011; Noeske et al. 2007). Therefore, removing the mass dependence of the SFRs gives a better estimate on the relative star formation activity of galaxies. Fig. 10 Specific star formation rate (sSFR) vs. redshift for the entire VLA/24 μm sample (grey dots) and for the radio-excess sources, divided into their three IR categories: IR AGN (red squares), IR SFG (blue circles) and passive systems (asterisks). The four sources plotted at the bottom (with a symbolic value of sSFR = 0.001 Gy-1) are the four IR AGN for which the SFR could not be estimated (see Sect. 4.3). The tracks in the plot show the sSFR evolution with redshift for main sequence star-forming galaxies (MS; solid line) and for starburst galaxies (SB; dotted line) from Elbaz et al. (2011). The radio-excess sources have typically lower star formation than the star-forming galaxy population detected at 24 μm. We calculated the sSFR by simply dividing the SFRs (Sect. 4.3) by the galaxy stellar masses (see Sect. 2.6 and Fig. 1). In Fig. 10 we show the sSFR as a function of redshift for the entire VLA/24 μm sample (grey dots) and for the radio-excess sample, distinguishing between the different types of sources according to their IR SEDs (i.e., IR SFG, IR AGN and passive). In the plot we also show the sSFR-z evolution track for MS star-forming galaxies and for starburst (SB) galaxies defined by Elbaz et al. (2011). Our radio-excess sources typically lie below the sSFR tracks for star-forming galaxies, indicating that they have, on average, lower star formation contribution when compared to radio-normal sources of the same stellar mass. However, if we consider the average sSFR for the IR SFGs, IR AGN and passive systems amongst our radio-excess sample, we find that for the IR SFGs ⟨ sSFR⟩IR SFG = 1.15 ± 0.26 Gy-1, consistent with the MS star-forming galaxies (assuming an average redshift of z ≈ 1.5), while for the IR AGN, the average sSFR is significantly lower: ⟨ sSFR⟩IR AGN = 0.38 ± 0.14 Gy-1 11. The sources identified as passive from our SED fitting analysis have, in fact, sSFR 10% of the average MS galaxies at a given redshift (Fig. 10) and are more massive (⟨ M∗⟩ ≈11.5 M⊙; see Table 3) than the rest of the sample (⟨ M∗⟩ ≈ 11.0 M⊙ and ⟨ M∗⟩ ≈ 10.7 M⊙ for IR AGN and IR SFGs, respectively)12. Previous studies have found that galaxies hosting X-ray selected AGN typically have star formation rates in agreement with the MS star-forming galaxies (e.g. Alonso-Herrero et al. 2008; Mullaney et al. 2012; Santini et al. 2012; Silverman et al. 2009; Xue et al. 2010) and do not show different properties from galaxies not hosting AGN. This suggests that the radio-excess technique tends to select a different AGN population from those selected in X-rays, with the host galaxies of radio-excess AGN having on average less ongoing star formation when compared to the hosts of X-ray selected AGN. We note that thanks to our SED decomposition, we were able to calculate the SFRs (and sSFRs) more accurately than in many of the previous works mentioned above by removing any AGN contribution to the IR luminosity (see Sect. 4.3). This gives us smaller sSFR values than those resulting assuming a pure SFG dominated IR luminosity. However, we found that the discrepancies between the sSFR of radio-excess AGN and X-ray AGN hosts are real and are not due to the technique adopted to calculate the LIR (and therefore sSFR). In fact, if we estimate the sSFRs for all of the X-ray detected sources in the VLA/24 μm sample (see Sect. 2.4), we obtain good agreement with the MS sSFR (Del Moro et al., in prep.). We therefore conclude that the host galaxies of radio-excess AGN are growing at a slower rate than the typical X-ray selected AGN hosts. Since many of our radio-excess sources are not detected in X-rays, it seems that the excess radio emission can reveal a complementary AGN population to that selected in the X-ray band. Since in the local Universe more radio-loud AGN are preferentially found in galaxy groups and clusters (e.g. Best 2004; Kauffmann et al. 2008), as opposed to typical radio-quiet AGN that tend to reside in less dense regions (e.g. Kauffmann et al. 2004), we want to verify whether the radio-excess AGN also reside in different environments than the typical X-ray selected AGNs. We therefore cross-matched the positions and redshifts of our radio-excess sources with those of extended X-ray sources, corresponding to known clusters, in the GOODS-N field (e.g. Bauer et al. 2002). As search regions we used the ellipses defining the extent of the X-ray emission, reported in Table 1 of Bauer et al. (2002). We found that only two out of the 51 radio-excess AGN in our sample (specifically sources #6 and #17 from Table 3) lie within the X-ray extended emission regions from Bauer et al. (2002); only one of these two sources (#17; i.e. only ≈2% of the radio-excess sample) has a redshift matching that of the galaxy cluster (z = 1.01; Bauer et al. 2002) and therefore is likely to be associated with the cluster. The large majority of our radio-excess sources lie in less dense environments, similarly to the X-ray selected AGN population. The lower sSFRs observed for our sources compared to MS galaxies and X-ray AGN hosts suggest that the radio-excess characteristic of our sources is not only due to a stronger radio core emission from the AGN than in “radio-normal” sources, but also to a dimming of the emission from star formation, which enhances, by contrast, the radio excess. The decreasing average sSFR for the different types of radio-excess sources identified through our SED analysis (i.e. IR SFG, IR AGN, passive; Sect. 4.3) indicates that we might be looking at different stages of BH-galaxy evolution: from the IR SFG that are the more active and possibly the most dust-obscured sources (see Sect. 5.2), where the presence of the AGN is testified only by the radio-excess, to the IR AGN, where the dust obscuration is progressively lower (although still very high in some cases; see Sect. 5.1), and the AGN is detected at radio, IR and often X-ray bands, while the star formation is quenching. At the final stage there are the passive systems, where the star formation has stopped and the SMBH is slowly accreting in a massive, passive galaxy (e.g. Hickox et al. 2009; Hopkins et al. 2006a). 6. Summary and conclusions Using deep IR Spitzer and Herschel data, as part of the GOODS-Herschel program, and radio VLA data in the GOODS-N field, we performed a detailed SED analysis for 458 sources with spectroscopic or photometric redshift identification (z ≤ 3.0). From the best-fit SEDs we calculated the FIR flux (fFIR; λ = 42.5 − 122.5 μm) and the FIR-radio relation (q) to identify a sample of sources with excess radio 1.4 GHz emission over that expected for star-forming galaxies (q ≈ 2.2; Helou et al. 1985). We obtained a sample of 51 (≈11% of the initial sample) radio-excess AGN (q 1.68) and investigated their radio, IR and X-ray properties. The main results of our analysis can be summarised as follows: We found that the fraction of radio-excess sources increases with X-ray luminosity (Sect. 4.2), suggesting the more luminous AGN are also more powerful in the radio band, although not necessarily radio-loud. This suggests that there is a wide distribution of radio power amongst the AGN population and that the radio-excess sources (i.e. sources with intermediate radio power) constitute a significant part of the total AGN population. The radio-excess sample seems to be composed of a heterogeneous mix of sources: i) IR AGN (≈45%, 23/51), which are the “classical” highly accreting AGN hosted in star-forming galaxies; ii) IR SFG (≈45%, 23/51), which are likely to host moderate luminosity (LX 1043 erg s-1) or dust-obscured luminous AGN, whose emission eludes our detection capabilities in the IR and often the X-ray bands, but they are identifiable through their radio excess; iii) low accretion rate AGNs (e.g. RIAFs, FR Is) hosted in passive, non-star forming galaxies (≈10%, 5/51), where the excess radio emission is likely to be due to the presence of strong radio jets and lobes, in addition to a radio core (Sect. 5). Only 27 of the radio-excess AGN (~53%) are detected in the X-ray band; the large number of X-ray undetected sources suggests that many radio-excess sources might be heavily obscured (possibly Compton-thick) AGN (Sect. 5.1). Indeed, amongst the 24 X-ray undetected sources, five sources (i.e. ~20%) show a strong AGN component in the IR band. The majority of the X-ray undetected sources are IR SFGs, which are likely to be low-moderate luminosity AGN, or luminous dust-obscured AGN, as demonstrated by the detection of a compact radio core in deep VLBI observations for one of these X-ray undetected IR SFGs (Sect. 5.2). Assuming that the local correlation between the AGN L6 μm and the X-ray (2–10 keV) luminosity holds out to high redshift, we estimate the fraction of Compton-thick candidates amongst our radio-excess AGN to be ~20% (~43% amongst the IR detected AGN 10/23); however the unambiguous classification of these sources requires other diagnostics, which are not feasible with the current data (Sect. 5.1). The specific star formation rates (sSFR) estimated for the radio-excess AGN are on average lower than those observed for main sequence star-forming galaxies, or X-ray AGN host galaxies, indicating that the radio-excess technique tends to select a different AGN population than the X-rays (Sect. 5.4). This also suggests that the excess radio emission measured for our sources is not only due to strong radio emission from the AGN, but to a combination of two effects: i) radio core emission from the AGN and ii) dimmed star formation emission. Moreover, the progressively lower sSFR observed for IR SFGs, IR AGN and passive systems, suggests that through our radio-excess sources we might look at different stages of BH-galaxy co-evolution.

We applied these templates to decompose the total SEDs of high redshift sources (z ≤ 3) into AGN and galaxy components. To determine the best-fitting solutions, we firstly fit to the Spitzer and Herschel photometric data a simple model including only the SFG template, using χ2 minimisation, yielding 5 SED solutions (one for each SFG template). We then fit the data with a more complex SFG + AGN (plus extinction on the AGN component only) model, using an f-test to determine the best-fitting solutions. The criteria we used to choose whether the AGN component significantly improves the fit are: i) an f-test probability >90% confidence when adding the AGN template to the fit; ii) this first condition must be met in the majority of the SED fitting solutions (i.e. at least 3 out of 5). This SED fitting approach (Sect. 3.1) and the criteria chosen to identify the best-fit models were selected based on the results of careful tests performed on a sample of 30 sources in the VLA/24 μm detected sample (Sect. 2) for which Spitzer IRS low-resolution spectroscopy is available (covering the wavelength range λ ≈ 3−20 μm, rest-frame; Kirkpatrick et al. 2012; Murphy et al. 2009; Pope et al. 2008). These sources are all detected in the X-ray band (Alexander et al. 2003) and the majority of them are also detected in at least one of the Herschel bands at 100, 160 and/or 250 μm (29/30 sources; Table 4). Our tests consist of two main steps: 1. constraining the AGN and star formation components using theIRS spectra (plus Herschel data), which providemore detailed information (e.g. PAH features or featurelesspower-law continuum) than photometry alone on the sourceemission at MIR wavelengths, where the AGNcontribution affects the SED the most(λ ≲ 30 − 40 μm); 2. performing the SED fits using only Spitzer and Herschel photometric points (not including the IRS spectra), testing various criteria to select, amongst the different solutions, the best-fitting models that more closely matched the IRS spectral fitting results. In analysing the IRS spectra, we also included the Herschel 100, 160 and 250 μm flux densities to help constrain the SEDs in the FIR band, as the spectra alone cover too small a wavelength range to allow a reliable extrapolation of the SEDs in the broad IR band. In fact, fitting just the IRS spectra (not including the Herschel data) tend to underestimate the amount of star formation contribution to the total emission, favoring higher contribution from the AGN component, instead. Since the Spitzer IRS spectra provide a large amount of data for fitting our SED templates, we fitted the spectra (and Herschel data) directly using a model including both SFG and AGN (plus extinction) templates described in Sect. 3.1 to measure galaxy and AGN contributions to the total IR emission. We note that because the IRS data have much smaller uncertainties compared to the Herschel data, we increased the errors on the IRS spectra by a constant factor to be of the same order of magnitude of the Herschel data errors13 (when S/N > 3); this is to avoid the SED fitting results being dominated by the Spitzer IRS data (which would have much more “weight” on the resulting χ2 than the Herschel data), and also to account for the intrinsic scatter between our 5 discrete SFG templates. We adopted χ2 minimisation to evaluate the best fit of the 5 SFG templates. We note that due to the high signal-to-noise ratio of the IRS spectra (despite the enhancement applied to the errors), the resulting χ2 values for all the fits are very high (χ2/d.o.f. ≫ 1) and therefore cannot be used as an absolute measure of the goodness of the fit in the usual way (see also Mullaney et al. 2011). However, since the χ2 calculation is affected by this issue in the same way for each solution, a comparison between χ2 values can still be used to identify the best-fit amongst the five different solutions: the spectral fit yielding the minimum χ2 was chosen as the best-fitting solution. It is important to note however, that in some cases the difference in χ2 between different solutions is small, and therefore, the chosen best-fit model is not the only acceptable solution to reproduce the data. To overcome this issue, instead of choosing one solution as the best-fit, we used a weighted mean between the five different fitting solutions to retrieved the 6 μm luminosity of the AGN (from the fitted AGN component), the FIR fluxes and the q values for the sources. The χ2 values were used to calculate appropriate weights in order to give the maximum weight to the solution with the minimum χ2 (i.e. L6 μm,AGN/L6 μm,tot > 0.5) was measured in 16 cases. From these IRS spectra (+Herschel) fits, we also determined that when the AGN is found to contribute less than ~30% to the total (AGN + SFG) emission at 6 μm, the total SED is not significantly affected by the presence of the AGN component compared to that of a pure SFG. Therefore, when the AGN is not significantly detected with our SED fitting approach (i.e. when using photometric Spitzer and Herschel data only), we chose the upper limit for the AGN luminosity at 6 μm to be 30% of the total 6 μm luminosity (see Sect. 5.1). After using the IRS spectra to obtain good constraints on the AGN and star formation components, we then performed several sets of SED fits to these sources using Spitzer 8, 16, 24 μm and Herschel 100, 160, 250 μm flux densities only (not including the IRS spectra), testing different criteria to select the best-fitting solutions, in particular to establish the significance of the AGN component in the fits. These tests were performed to find the best “recipe” to recover, with these sparse photometric data points (which is the approach adopted in this paper; see Sect. 3.1), the results obtained from the IRS spectral (plus Herschel data) fits (Fig. A.2 and Table 4). As for the IRS spectra, the Spitzer photometric data have much smaller uncertainties than the Herschel data; we therefore increased the errors on the 8, 16 and 24 μm flux densities (by constant factors for all of the sources) during the SED fitting process in order for each data point to have a similar “weight” in the fit and to allow for the intrinsic scatter on the templates. We note, however, that in these SED fits, as for the IRS + Herschel data fits, the reduced χ2 alone (i.e. χ2/d.o.f. ≈ 1) is not a reliable indicator of the goodness of fit since the χ2 is very sensitive to the errors on the data points used in the fits, especially when the number of data points is limited, as in our case. Nevertheless, as we pointed out above, the relative χ2 can still be used to determine the best-fit model between two sets of solutions (SFG only, or SFG + AGN; Fig. 3), so we performed an f-test, which compares the χ2 values and d.o.f. of the two models (see Sect. 3.1), to measure the improvement of the fit obtained by including the AGN component to the model. We tested the reliability of the best-fitting solutions by varying the f-test probability threshold between the two adopted models (SFG and SFG + AGN) and also varying the number of solutions that needed to pass this threshold for the model to be accepted as the best-fit. A higher confidence level (e.g. 95% or 99%) allowed us to recover the AGN component detected in the IRS spectra only in a small number of cases, while missing some very obvious, strong IR AGN, where the AGN emission found from the IRS contributes 100% to the total 6 μm luminosity. We therefore lowered the confidence level threshold from the f-test to be at least 90%. The f-test was performed between each pair of SED fitting solutions (i.e. for each SFG template) in order to verify whether the need of the AGN component was dependent on the SFG template used in the fits. Indeed, we recognised that the fits performed with one particular SFG template (“SB5” in Mullaney et al. 2011) typically required an AGN component with higher confidence than the others. To avoid biases on the results due to the choice of SFG template and thus to remove the dependence of the fitting solutions on any specific templates, we decided to accept the AGN component as significant only if the f-test criterion was met in at least 3 of the 5 SED fitting solutions, otherwise we conservatively assumed the simple SFG model as the best-fit. As previously seen from the Spitzer IRS spectral fits, in some cases different fitting solutions yielded small differences in χ2 values meaning that a unique solution could not be defined. Therefore, once we established the best-fit model (SFG or SFG + AGN), we obtained the 6 μm luminosity of the AGN, the total FIR fluxes and the q values for our sources using a weighted average of the values calculated from all the best-fit model solutions14 (as for the fits of the Spitzer IRS spectra + Herschel data); the errors on the estimated averages were calculated as weighted average variances. To test the results for our chosen SED fitting approach, we compared the 6 μm luminosity of the AGN obtained from the IRS spectral fitting (+Herschel data) to that obtained from the SED fitting performed using Spitzer and Herschel photometry (Fig. A.1). In Fig. A.1 we distinguish between sources with a dominant AGN component at 6 μm (IR AGN: L6 μm, AGN/L6 μm, tot > 0.5) from those where the AGN component is not significantly detected (IR SFG: L6 μm, AGN/L6 μm, tot 0.5). In ≈87% of the cases the IR classification of the sources obtained from the IRS spectra and the SED fits are consistent with each other (12 IR AGN and 14 IR SFGs) and the 6 μm luminosities measured from the two types of analysis are in good agreement (Table 4). In the remaining cases (≈13%), the two different analyses yielded different results: the IRS spectral analysis identified an AGN component in four further sources, which are missed by our SED fitting analysis; this is because the criteria we adopted in defining the AGN component as significant in our SED fits are very conservative and thus, while we can easily identify the AGN where L6 μm, AGN/L6 μm, tot ≫ 0.5, we are likely to miss some cases where the AGN component is not strongly dominant in the MIR band. With this in mind, we can consider the detection of the AGN emission component through our SED fitting approach as robust. Fig. A.1 Comparison of the AGN 6 μm luminosity obtained from the SED fitting of the photometric Spitzer and Herschel data points (νL6 μm, SED) versus the L6 μm estimated from the IRS spectral (+ Herschel data points) fitting (νL6 μm, IRS). For the IR SFGs, where the AGN component was not significantly detected, we plotted an upper limit of the AGN L6 μm (i.e., 30% of the total 6 μm luminosity; see Appendix A). Sources where the classification from the two analyses agree are shown as filled symbols: IR AGN (filled squares) and IR SFG (filled circles). The AGN identified only from the IRS spectral fit are shown as open squares. As a final verification of the reliability of our SED fitting approach, we plot in Fig. A.2 the best-fit SEDs (using Spitzer and Herschel photometric points only) for the 30 sources analysed here in comparison to the Spitzer IRS spectra; we showed only one of the best-fitting solutions for each source. The SEDs were fitted using only Spitzer 8, 16, 24 μm, and Herschel 100, 160, 250 μm photometric points (black circles); the Spitzer-IRAC data points at 3.6, 4.5, and 5.8 μm (red triangles) and the VLA radio data points (black star) are over-plotted to the SEDs (not used in the fits) to show the agreement with the resulting SEDs. The Spitzer IRS spectra (cyan line) are also shown, but they are not included in the SED fits. The panels on the top right of each plot is a zoom on the IRS spectra (2.5−25 μm rest-frame) to better show the comparison between the best-fit SEDs and the spectra. In general, there is very good agreement with the resulting SED and the IRS spectra, even though we stress that here the spectra were not used to constrain the SEDs. This result is a confirmation of the validity of our templates and SED fitting approach. The only few cases (2/30; i.e. CXOJ123555.13+620901.7 and CXOJ123726.51+622026.8) where the SEDs differ from the MIR IRS spectra are those where deep silicate features are present; in these cases the photometric data points do not provide enough information to predict the amount of extinction needed to reproduce these strong features. However, since the purpose of our analysis is not to measure the strength of the spectral features, such as silicate absorption/emission features or PAH emission lines, but to estimate the AGN and SFG contribution to the overall IR SEDs, we can ignore the discrepancies between SEDs and spectra for these sources. Fig. A.2 Best-fitting solutions to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the X-ray detected sources in GOODS-N with Spitzer-IRS spectroscopy (Kirkpatrick et al. 2012; Murphy et al. 2009; Pope et al. 2008). The dotted lines represent the AGN component and the dashed lines indicate the SFG component; the total SEDs are represented as solid lines. The Spitzer 8, 16, 24 μm and the Herschel 100, 160, 250 μm data points (black circles) have been used to constrain the SEDs, while the Spitzer-IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 μm (red stars) and the VLA 1.4 GHz (black star) radio data points are over plotted on the SEDs but they are not included in the fit. The Spitzer-IRS spectrum is also shown (cyan line), but it is NOT used to constrain the SEDs. On the top right-hand side of each plot, a zoom on the Spitzer-IRS spectrum is shown (2.5–25 μm); our best-fit SEDs are typically in very good agreement with the Spitzer-IRS spectra. Fig. A.2 continued. Fig. A.2 continued. Appendix B: SEDs of the radio-excess sources In this appendix the best-fit SED plots for the entire radio-excess sample (51 sources) are reported (Fig. B.1); for each source we only plotted the SED with the lowest χ2 value amongst the best-fitting model solutions (see Sects. 3.1 and Appendix A). Fig. B.1 Best-fit SEDs for the 51 sources in the radio-excess sample. The total SEDs are shown as black solid lines, the AGN templates are shown as dotted lines and the SFG templates as dashed lines. Filled circles represent the Spitzer 8, 16, 24 μm and the Herschel 100, 160, 250 μm flux densities, which are used to constrain the SEDs. Open symbols indicate the data that were not included in the SED fitting process: red triangles are Spitzer-IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 μm flux densities, black open circles are SPIRE 350 and 500 μm, and black squares are VLA 1.4 GHz flux densities; the blue stars represent the 6 μm luminosity of the AGN predicted from the X-ray luminosity (2–10 keV, rest-frame) using the Lutz et al. (2004) relation for local unobscured AGN; we note that these points do not always match the IR AGN component because the X-ray luminosity tends to underestimate the intrinsic AGN power if the AGN emission is heavily absorbed. For the passive sources we plotted the SFG template upper limit (grey line) and an elliptical galaxy template (long dashed line; Sect. 4.3) to show that it could well represent the data, although we stress that this latter template is not included in our SED fitting analysis. The rise of the IRAC data point at short wavelengths observed for many sources is due to the emission from the galaxy old stellar population. Fig. B.1 continued. Fig. B.1 continued.

        "abstract": "<BR /> Aims: The nearby Type Ia supernova (SN) 2011fe has provided an unprecedented opportunity for deriving some of the properties of its progenitor. This work provides additional and independent information on the circumstellar environment in which the explosion took place. <BR /> Methods: We obtained high-resolution spectroscopy of SN 2011fe for 12 epochs, from 8 to 86 days after the estimated date of explosion, testing in particular the time evolution of Ca II and Na I. <BR /> Results: Three main absorption systems are identified from Ca II and Na I, one associated to the Milky Way, one probably arising within a high-velocity cloud, and one most likely associated to the halo of M101. The total (Galactic and host galaxy) reddening, deduced from the integrated equivalent widths (EW) of the Na i lines, is E<SUB>B - V</SUB> ≲ 0.05 mag. The host galaxy absorption is dominated by a component detected at the same velocity measured from the 21-cm H i line at the projected SN position (~180 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). During the ~3 months covered by our observations its EW peak-to-peak variation is 15.6 ± 6.5 mÅ. This small and marginally significant change is shown to be compatible with the geometric effects produced by the rapid SN photosphere expansion coupled to the patchy fractal structure of the interstellar medium (ISM). The observed behavior is fully consistent with ISM properties similar to those derived for our own Galaxy, with evidences for structures on scales ≲ 100 AU. <BR /> Conclusions: SN 2011fe appears to be surrounded by a \"clean\" environment. The lack of blueshifted, time-variable absorption features is fully consistent with the progenitor being a binary system with a main-sequence, or even another degenerate star.Based on observations collected at the Mercator telescope, Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, Nordic Optical Telescope at Roque de los Muchachos, La Palma (Spain), and at the 1.82 m Copernico telescope on Mt. Ekar (Asiago, Italy).",

        "body": "1. Introduction Since the introduction of the accreting white dwarf (WD) scenario (Wheelan Iben 1973), the question about the nature of the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae (hereafter SN Ia) has become more and more pressing (see Patat 2011, for a general review on the subject). One of the most well beaten tracks for obtaining information on the progenitor system has been the search for imprints of circumstellar material (CSM) lost by the system prior to the explosion. Notwithstanding the extensive attempts undertaken to detect such material, as of today no signs of it have been found in Branch-normal events in the form of optical (Lundqvist 2003; 2005; Mattila et al. 2005), radio (Panagia et al. 2006, Chomiuk et al. 2011) and UV/X-ray emission (Immler et al. 2006). Similarly, no evidence for the explosion effects on the companion (e.g. collision and/or envelope stripping) was found so far (Hayden et al. 2010; Bianco et al. 2011; Leonard 2007).

These non-detections were generally interpreted as favoring progenitor systems where the donor is either a main sequence (MS) star, or another degenerate object. However, it is only with the advent of SN 2011fe that very stringent constraints could be placed on the exploding star and its companion. This SN Ia was discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory in the nearby, face-on galaxy M101, less than one day after the explosion (Nugent et al. 2011a,b). The detailed optical and UV studies made possible by the very early detection and the relatively small distance led to two important conclusions: i) the exploding star must be a compact body (a C-O WD is most favored); and ii) systems with Roche-lobe overflowing giants and MS stars as companions are excluded (Li et al. 2011; Nugent et al. 2011c; Brown et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2012; Bloom et al. 2011). The very stringent limits on the mass loss rate set by radio and X-ray observations point in the same direction (Horesh et al. 2012; Chomiuk et al. 2012; Margutti et al. 2012). After studying an object whose progenitor system is reasonably well known, we can now ask ourselves a new question. Would we recognize similar systems in other SN Ia, whose distance and discovery time do not allow the close, multi-wavelength scrutiny that was possible for SN 2011fe? The key problem here is that one needs to consider the largest possible number of observables, because SN Ia coming from different channels may display similar spectra and light curves. In this article we focus on the properties of the circumstellar environment. For this purpose, and following previous studies (e.g. Patat et al. 2007a; Simon et al. 2009), we obtained multi-epoch, high-resolution, optical spectroscopy of SN 2011fe covering the first three months of its evolution. The paper, reporting the results of this campaign, is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we give an account of the observations and data reduction. Section 3 describes the detection of narrow absorption features, whereas Sect. 4 discusses the implications on the extinction suffered by the SN. In Sect. 5 we illustrate the properties of the intervening gas as derived from Voigt profile fittings, and we study their behavior as a function of time. The results of this study in connection to the progenitor’s nature are finally discussed in Sect. 6, which also summarizes our conclusions. 2. Observations and data reduction We obtained high-resolution spectroscopy of SN 2011fe for 12 epochs, ranging from 8 to 86 days after the estimated date of explosion (JD = 2 455 797.2; Nugent et al. 2011c). The observing log is presented in Table 1, which includes exposure times, phase from maximum light, epoch from explosion, airmass, and heliocentric correction. Phases were computed by adopting a rise time of 18.3 days (Röpke et al. 2012). The observations were carried out with four different instrumental setups. These are summarized in Table 2 and are detailed in the next subsections. 2.1. Asiago Echelle Spectrograph Seven spectra of SN 2011fe were obtained with the REOSC Asiago Echelle Spectrograph (hereafter AES) that is attached to the 1.82 m telescope on Mt. Ekar (Asiago, Italy). The spectrograph is equipped with an an E2V CCD42-40 AIMO, back-illuminated detector (2048 × 2048 pixel, 13.5 μm in size). A 2′′ slit was used, with a fixed east-west orientation, yielding a resolving power R = λ/Δλ ~ 18 000. The wavelength range covered by the spectra is 3780–7620 Å. The data reduction was performed with tasks within the IRAF1 ECHELLE package following the standard procedures. All images were first overscan-corrected and trimmed. A normalized flat-field image was then derived from observations of a halogen lamp and was used to flat field the science exposures. Next, each spectral order was traced and the spectra were extracted with the optimum extraction algorithm of Horne (1986), which simultaneously subtracts the scattered light. The transformation from pixels to wavelength was derived from observations of a thorium-argon arc-lamp. Table 2 Instrumental setups. ID Site Telescope Res. Disp.

FIES Fig. 1 Narrow absorption components toward SN 2011fe for Ca ii K (upper panel; day 21) and Na i D2 (lower panel; day 11.2). Main absorption features are marked by vertical dashed lines. Two spectra (Aug. 31 and Sep. 29, 2011) were obtained with the fiber-fed (1.3′′) echelle spectrograph (FIES2) mounted at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) on La Palma (Spain). We used the medium-resolution fiber, which provides a resolving power R ~ 48 000 and a continuous spectral coverage from 3700 to 7300 Å in a single exposure. Data were reduced using standard IRAF tasks, as outlined in the previous section. 2.3. HERMES Two spectra (Sep. 7 and 13, 2011) were obtained with the High Efficiency and Resolution Mercator Echelle Spectrograph (HERMES; Raskin et al. 2011), mounted on the Mercator 1.2 m telescope in La Palma. HERMES is a high-resolution fiber-fed (2.5′′) echelle spectrograph offering spectral resolution of R ~ 80 000, and full spectral coverage from 3770 to 9000 Å in a single exposure. Data were processed with an automated data reduction pipeline that includes bias correction from the prescan region on the CCD, flat-field correction via halogen lamps, wavelength calibration through Th-Ar reference spectra, cosmic clipping, and background modelization. 2.4. SARG Two spectra (Sep. 3, and Nov. 18, 2011) were obtained with the Spettrografo Alta Risoluzione Galileo (SARG; Gratton et al. 2001), mounted at the 3.5 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) in La Palma. SARG is a cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph that provides spectral resolution ranging from R = 29 000 up to R = 164 000. For our observations we used the cross-disperser #3 grism, a GG455 order-sorting filter, and slit #2 (0.8′′ × 5.3′′). This setup yields R ~ 66 000 and a wavelength range 4600–6150 Å. The data reduction was performed using standard IRAF tasks, as outlined in Sect. 2.1. The removal of telluric absorption features was performed by means of synthetic atmospheric models. The procedure is discussed in Appendix A. For the sky background subtraction, we note that in some spectra the terrestrial Na i D emission components (both natural and artificial) are not completely removed. Because of the wavelength shift of most features, this problem affects only a Galactic absorption close to null restframe velocity (see Sect. 3), whose profile (and thus equivalent width) is most likely affected by the incomplete sky subtraction. Equivalent widths (EW) were estimated by integrating the line profiles in the telluric-corrected spectra. The local pseudo-continuum was derived by means of a straight line least-squares fit to two symmetric, equally extended regions on either side of the absorption. The EW uncertainty was derived using the formulation by Chalabaev Maillard (1983), which includes the uncertainty on the continuum determination. 3. Narrow absorption features in SN 2011fe 3.1. Ca ii HK and Na i D Several Ca ii H, K and Na i D components are detected at different velocities, as shown in Fig. 1, which presents the highest resolution spectra available for the two wavelength ranges (obtained with HERMES and SARG, respectively; see Tables 1 and 2). Two main Galactic absorption systems are detected around −70 and −20 km s-1 (marked as A and B in Fig. 1), with weaker and diffuse absorptions possibly present at intermediate velocities (see the Ca ii profile). A third system is clearly detected at about +130 km s-1 (C). The recession velocity of M101 is 241 ± 2 km s-1 (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991), and therefore this component may be generated within a high-velocity cloud (HVC) that belongs either to the Milky Way or to the host galaxy. The radial velocity derived from 21-cm line observations at the projected SN site is about 180 km s-1 (Bosma et al. 1981; their Fig. 1). This makes the association to M101 more plausible, although not certain (see also Sect. 5). Finally, we detect an absorption system with two main components at about 180 and 195 km s-1 (D). These velocities are fully consistent with the radial velocity field at the projected SN location (Bosma et al. 1981). This strongly suggests that the corresponding absorptions arise in M101. All features are detected in both H and K lines, while system C is not detected in Na i. The component close to 195 km s-1 is clearly detected in Na i only in the highest signal-to-noise (S/N) spectrum (SARG, day 11) with a total equivalent width EW = 7 ± 2 mÅ, while it is only marginally detected in all other spectra. Nugent et al. (2011c) reported the detection of one single absorption feature (EW = 45 ± 9 mÅ), which they identified as Na i D2 at v = 194 ± 1 km s-1. Although the weighted average EW we derive from our data (EW(Na i D2) = 47 ± 1 mÅ, EW(Na i D1) = 27 ± 1 mÅ; see Sect. 5.1) is consistent with that reported by Nugent et al., the velocity discrepancy is statistically very significant (~14 km s-1), and cannot be explained in terms of the quoted errors. Once applying the heliocentric corrections listed in Table 1 to the different spectra, the velocities deduced for the Na i D components all agree to within a few 0.1 km s-1. The average heliocentric velocity deduced from the best-fit profile of the most intense host galaxy component (see Sect. 5) is 179.6 ± 0.2 km s-1. Given the very consistent results we obtain from different setups and epochs, we consider our result to be correct to within the reported errors. 3.2. Other absorptions A careful inspection of the telluric-corrected spectra that cover relevant wavelength range shows no trace of the two typical K i lines at 7665 and 7699 Åfor the Galaxy or for M101 (at the velocities derived for the Ca ii and Na i features. See previous section). For the host galaxy the 5-σ detection limit derived from the HERMES spectrum taken on day 15 is EW(K i λ7699) 5 mÅ. The K i λ7665 is severely affected by a telluric absorption, and so the upper limit estimate for this line is more problematic. However, the two lines have very similar strengths, and so the limit derived above applies to both of them. Similar considerations apply to the non-detection of Ti ii, Ca i, CH and CH+. Finally, none of the known strong Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs; 5780, 5797, 6284, 6379, 6613; Herbig 1995) are detected. Table 3 Na i and Ca ii interstellar cloud model parameters.

Reddening The galactic Na i D components are very weak (see Fig. 1), indicating that SN 2011fe suffers a very low Galactic reddening. The integrated EW(Na i D1) derived from our highest S/N spectrum (SARG, day 11) for the Galactic components (systems A and B in Fig. 1) is 38 ± 5 mÅ. Applying the relation inferred by Munari Zwitter (1997) for Galactic reddening, we derive EB − V = 0.01, which is consistent with the expected Galactic extinction along the line of sight to M 101 (EB − V = 0.009 mag; Schlegel et al. 1998). According to the Munari Zwitter relation, the expected EW for the K i λ7699 is ~4 mÅ, which is fully consistent with the lack of K i detection in our spectra. As shown in the previous section, we detect two features most probably associated to the host galaxy, at ~180 and ~200 km s-1, with the latter contributing only marginally to the total Na i column density. The integrated D2 EW measured on the SARG spectrum (day 11) is 47 ± 2 mÅ (EW(Na i D1) = 25 ± 1 mÅ). Applying the Munari Zwitter relation, this turns into EB − V = 0.014 (AV = 0.04 mag), in agreement with the value derived by Nugent et al. (2011c) using the same method. Because the total EW(Na i D2) is 85 ± 6 mÅ, we conclude that the reddening along the line of sight to SN 2011fe is most probably lower than 0.05 (Munari Zwitter 1997). Fig. 2 Na i D spectra for each epoch (black histograms), with best-fit models overlaid (red curves). Spectra were normalized and offset vertically for display. Heliocentric velocity scale is given with respect to the Na D2 line rest wavelength. The spurious emissions observed in some spectra around 0 and 300 km s-1 are residuals of the sky subtraction (see Sect. 2). 5. Narrow absorption line modeling To derive interstellar cloud velocities, Doppler widths, and column densities we modeled the best resolution and S/N ratio spectra using the vapid routine (Howarth et al. 2002). Saturation effects were implicitly taken into account by fitting simultaneously lines of the same species (Na i D1 and D2; Ca ii H and K). The results for the FIES, HERMES and SARG (first epoch only) spectra are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 for Na i and Ca ii. The Na i spectra require five components for a good fit, while nine components were required for Ca ii. Error estimates were derived using Monte Carlo noise replication. The models were re-fitted to 1000 replicated data-sets, each with Gaussian noise of rms equal to that of the continuum added. The ± 68% ranges in the resulting data give rigorous 1-sigma errors on each parameter. Table 3 shows the results for each epoch, as well as the results of a weighted-average fit to all epochs, in which the fitted data points were weighted by the continuum S/N ratio of the respective spectra. The data show no evidence for statistically significant variations in cloud component velocities or Doppler b parameters between epochs (see below), therefore the v and b values were held fixed at the weighted-average fit values and only the N values were allowed to vary for each epoch. Column densities (cm-2) are given as base-ten logarithms. The units of v and b are km s-1. The analysis of Milky Way interstellar gas is beyond the scope of this paper. Here we mention that for the most pronounced Galactic feature (−23 km s-1), the N(Na i)/N(Ca ii) ratio is ~0.50, which is typical of galactic halos (Hobbs 1978; Crawford 1992; Bertin et al. 1993). Sembach Danks (1994) measured a mean Galactic halo N(Na i)/N(Ca ii) ~ 0.5. Interestingly, the N(Na i)/N(Ca ii) ratio for the main feature in M101 (+180 km s-1) is ~0.43, indicating that it may also originate in the halo of the host galaxy (see also King et al. 1995, for the case of SN 1994D). The really deviating case is that of the component at ~ 128 km s-1, which is clearly detected in Ca ii, but not in Na i. The upper limit to the Na i column density deduced from the high S/N ratio SARG spectrum (day 11) is 1.5 × 1010 cm-2, which yields N(Na i)/N(Ca ii) ≤ 0.04. Such low values are rarely observed and indicate a mild depletion of calcium onto dust grains. A similar case was observed for one high-velocity component along the line of sight to SN 2000cx, where Ca ii was detected, while Na i was not (Patat et al. 2007b). The corresponding ratio was N(Na i)/N(Ca ii) ≤ 0.1. Finally, King et al. (1995) found N(Na i)/N(Ca ii) = 0.1–0.3 for the high-velocity clouds observed along the line of sight to SN 1994D. Low ratios are, in general, typical of high velocity gas (Siluk Silk 1974). The low value we derived for the component at ~180 km s-1 is similar to those observed in intermediate- and high-velocity clouds by Molaro et al. (1993), who concluded that these clouds may contain very little dust, with calcium and sodium mainly in gaseous form (see also the properties measured by Cox et al. 2007, toward the LMC sight-lines). For these reasons it is reasonable to conclude that absorption system C (see Fig. 1) arises in an HVC. 5.1. Time evolution The derived cloud parameters show some marginal evidence for time variability. The only possibly significant variation is seen for the host galaxy Na i component at ~180 km s-1. While the logarithmic column density derived for this absorption is 11.44 ± 0.02 on days 8, 11, 15 and 21, on day 37 this grows to 11.52 ± 0.03, which indicates a variation at the 3-sigma level. One may be tempted to attribute this fluctuation to the different instrumental setups. However, a direct comparison of the two spectra taken on days 8 and 37 (both obtained with FIES and the same setup) clearly shows that both components D1 and D2 had consistently deepened by about 16% on the second epoch, while their FWHM remained unchanged. The integrated EWs directly measured on the two spectra are 23.6 ± 1.9, 46.1 ± 2.0 mÅ, and 30.4 ± 2.4, 53.0 ± 2.5 mÅ for D1 and D2 on the two epochs, respectively, implying a variation Δ EW(Na i D2) = 6.9 ± 3.2 mÅ. This strengthens the conclusion that whatever the reason for the change it cannot be attributed to a variation of instrumental resolution3. Fig. 3 Ca ii K spectra for each epoch for which these data were obtained (black histograms), with best-fit models overlaid (red curves). Spectra were normalized and offset vertically for display. Heliocentric velocity scale is given with respect to the Ca ii K line rest wavelength. Although AES spectra have a significantly lower resolution (16.7 km s-1, see Table 2), given the simple structure of the component at ~180 km s-1, they can be used together with the higher resolution data to study the variability on the whole time range spanned by the available observations (the relevant spectral regions are presented in Fig. A.2). To increase the S/N ratio we stacked the last two AES epochs (days 84 and 86). In Table 4 we report the EWs of Na i D2 and D1 directly measured on all our spectra, together with their associated rms uncertainties, the S/N ratio achieved at 5900 Å, and the FWHM resolution. The weighted average EWs computed over all epochs for the two lines are 47.1 ± 0.8 mÅ and 27.4 ± 1.1 mÅ, respectively (the standard deviation of the EW measurements is 2.6 and 3.4 mÅ, respectively). The EWs are plotted as a function of time in Fig. 4 (empty symbols indicate the lower resolution AES data). Although all measurements are within less than 3-sigma from the weighted average (and are therefore formally consistent with a null variation), there is a systematic increase in both components. This becomes more evident if one considers only the higher resolution data (filled symbols in Fig. 4). However, the overall trend is mainly dominated by the last SARG measurement, which is characterized by a low S/N ratio, and may therefore be affected by larger systematic errors (e.g. continuum determination and telluric correction). For this reason, we do not attach too much confidence to it. Because of the measured standard deviation (see above), the expected ± 3-σ peak-to-peak range is 2 × 3 × 2.6 mÅ = 15.6 mÅ. Considering the two extreme values (days 15.1 and 86.4), the observed peak-to-peak Na i D2 EW variation amounts to 15.6 ± 6.5 mÅ. This is fully consistent with the expected value, and we therefore regard it as an upper limit on the observed EW variation. This is very small compared to the changes seen in SN 2006X (Patat et al. 2007a), and SN 2007le (Simon et al. 2009) during the first three months of their evolution, which exceeded 100 mÅ4.

(*) The first epoch is from Nugent et al. (2011c). The fast SN expansion, coupled to the patchy nature of the ISM, can produce short time-scale changes in the IS absorption features. The analysis of their variations can be used to study the ISM small scale structure down to a few tens of AUs (Patat et al. 2010). The data currently available for SN 2011fe allow us to apply this method for the first three months of the SN evolution, when the photospheric radius increased from ~10 AU to ~350 AU. The simulations, run along the lines described in Patat et al. (2010), show that peak-to-peak variations ΔEW ≲ 15 mÅ imply ΔN ≲ 4 × 1011 cm-2 (ΔN/N ≲ 1.4). The maximum deviation measured in our simulations between any pair of epochs in the simulated data-set is ~16 mÅ. The rms EW variation from the weighted average is 2.6 mÅ, matching the value derived from the data (see previous section). The derived density contrast is compatible with the values measured in the Milky Way (Frail et al. 1994) and, therefore, the upper limit on the column density variation is fully in line with what is expected for a diffuse ISM with the same properties as in our own Galaxy. In other words, even if the observed fluctuations were real (including the apparent steady growth), these are consistent with the geometrical effect described in Patat et al. (2010). Therefore, we conclude that the absorption feature observed at ~180 km s-1 is most likely associated to the ISM, and is placed at distances larger than ~1019 cm (~10 light years) from the explosion site, where the effects of the SN radiation field on the Na i ionization balance are negligible (Patat et al. 2007a; Simon et al. 2009). Unfortunately, the S/N ratio at ~3900 Å in our data is not sufficient to study with the required accuracy the evolution of the Ca ii HK features, which in SNe 2006X and 2007le showed a distinct behavior (Patat et al. 2007a; Simon et al. 2009). 6. Discussion and conclusions SN 2011fe is a slightly subluminous, Branch-normal explosion, very similar to the well studied SN 1994D (Nugent et al. 2011c). However, it is by no means clear whether all “normal” events, which share very similar spectroscopic and photometric properties, do also share a common progenitor channel. For this reason it is important to tie the reasonably well known progenitor nature of this particular event to other properties, which may allow us to identify similar events in less favorable cases, i.e. at larger distances and without such exceptionally early discoveries. Among these is the circumstellar environment. The method proposed by Patat et al. (2007a) that was subsequently expanded by Simon et al. (2009) has been applied to study the CSM of number of SNe Ia. In two cases it led to the detection of time-variant Na i features, which were interpreted as arising in the material lost by the progenitor system before the explosion (Patat et al. 2007a; Simon et al. 2009). The velocities of this material are consistent with those of a red giant, hence favoring a symbiotic system. The complex velocity structure shown by SN 2006X was explained as being the possible outcome of recurrent-novae episodes (Patat et al. 2007a). This suggestion is supported by the results of a similar analysis carried out on the known recurrent nova RS Oph, which shows strikingly similar CSM properties (Patat et al. 2011). A study conducted on a large number of SN Ia has shown a statistically significant excess of blueshifted Na i features, which were interpreted as arising in material lost by the progenitor system (Sternberg et al. 2011). In addition, Foley et al. (2012) found that SN Ia displaying blue-shifted absorption features are characterized by higher ejecta velocities and redder colors with respect to the rest of the SN Ia sample. This gives support to the conclusions reached for SNe 2006X and 2007le. If this interpretation is correct, the measured fraction of SN Ia that display blueshifted features indicates that this channel is not a significant contributor to the global rate of thermonuclear events. This result has to be reconciled with opposing evidence provided by the lack of CSM signatures in radio, UV, and X-ray domains. The two apparently contradicting results may be reconciled by a complex CSM structure (Patat 2011, Chomiuk et al. 2011), a delay between mass loss and SN explosion (Chomiuk et al. 2012; Margutti et al. 2012), or stellar evolution effects (Justham 2011). In this context we emphasize that, although it showed a marked Na i variation, SN 2006X was not detected by the VLA (Stockdale et al. 2006; Chandra, et al. 2006). Therefore, if the interpretation of the blueshifted absorption features is correct, the absence of a radio detection does not necessarily imply that the CS environment is “clean”. Fig. 4 EW time evolution of Na i D2 (upper panel) and D1 (lower panel). Values are from Table 4. The short-dashed horizontal lines mark the weighted average values. AES data are identified by empty symbols. What makes SN 2011fe special is that its progenitor system was constrained with a significant confidence through a number of very stringent constraints (Li et al. 2011; Brown et al. 2012; Nugent et al. 2011c; Bloom et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2012). The absence of time-variable, blueshifted features and the “clean” environment reported in this paper fully agrees with the progenitor nature derived from the very early observations. The key question is whether the argument can be reversed, and the absence of such features in any SN Ia can be interpreted in terms of a similar progenitor, at least in a statistical sense. The answer to this question is awaiting detailed hydrodynamical modeling, which would tell us how frequently the physical conditions for producing observable narrow features are met, and what the viewing angle effects are (Mohamed et al., in prep.). Before this is accomplished, we can only speculate based on very small numbers. As pointed out by Nugent et al. (2011c), SN 2011fe is spectroscopically very similar to the somewhat subluminous events SN 1992A (Kirshner et al. 1993) and SN 1994D (Patat et al. 1996). Although the link between these objects needs to be assessed considering a number of observables, we notice that all three objects present a very “clean” circum/interstellar environment (Kirshner et al. 1993; King et al. 1995; Patat et al. 1996). In the schema devised by Sternberg et al. (2011), SNe 1994D and 2011fe would be classified in the single/symmetric group (SS-type, 14.3%), while SN 1992A would fall in the group with no absorption detection (N-type, 37.1%). An inspection of the SS group shows that three SS-type events (out of five) have a single component, similar to SN 2011fe. If we assume that in all these cases the absorption is attributable to the host galaxy (and not to the CSM environment), and we add them to the N-type events, then the fraction of “clean” events in the Sternberg et al. sample is ~46%. One can imagine cases where the CSM environment is “clean”, but the line of sight intercepts ISM clouds that are totally unrelated to the progenitor. Therefore, while the lack of conspicuous absorption features can be confidently interpreted in terms of a gas-free environment, the reverse argument does not hold. The projected position of SN 2011fe falls close to a peripheral spiral arm (see for instance Nugent et al. 2011c). However, the very low reddening and the absence of complex absorption structures strongly suggest that the explosion took place on the front side of the face-on host, most probably well above its galactic plane. Had the SN been placed on the rear side of the galaxy, the IS imprints would have been much more complex, irrespective of the progenitor’s nature deduced from the early data. Therefore the above fraction can only represent a lower limit. On the other hand, because of the viewing angle effects, the fraction of events allegedly produced by systems that host a giant estimated by Sternberg et al. (2011) is also a lower limit (20–25%). The sample of SN Ia with sufficient spectral resolution and time coverage is still relatively small, and therefore it may be premature to draw conclusions. The fraction of events showing time-variant features is ~17% (Patat 2011). Probing only the line of sight, this indicator also suffers from viewing-angle effects. In addition, the method only reveals material placed in the suitable range of distances from the SN that has the required densities (Patat et al. 2007a; Simon et al. 2009). Therefore, again, it gives only a lower limit to the fraction of events generated through this channel. Interestingly, this limit is reasonably similar to that derived from the excess of blue-shifted features (20%; Sternberg et al. 2011), and it supports the conclusion that this channel contributes in a significant way to the global SN Ia rate.
