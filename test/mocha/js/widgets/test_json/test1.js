While this relation can formally be obtainedusing Matrix-theory as a result of the Schwinger-Dyson equation, we here present abijection for the corresponding coefficient equation. Our construction is facilitatedby repeated application of a certain cutting, the contraction of edges, incident totwo vertices and the deletion of certain edges.1 Introductionk-cellular maps can be viewed as drawings on a topological surface, they represent a cell-complex of the latter and inherit the topological genus of the surface as their geometricrealization.In a seminal paper Harer and Zagier [13] computed the virtual Euler characteristic ofthe Moduli space of curves, independently derived by Penner [9] and still lack a combina-torial interpretation. Key object here play unicellular maps [4] of genus g with n edges,Ug(n), i.e. fatgraphs[10, 8, 7] with a unique boundary component. Most prominantly hereis the recursion(n+ 1)ug(n) = 2(2n− 1)ug(n− 1) + (2n− 1)(n− 1)(2n− 3)ug−1(n− 2)In [14, 2] the generating function of unicellular maps is obtained asUg(z) =Pg(z)(1− 4z)3g−1/2,where Pg(z) is polynomial defined over the integers of degree at most 3g−1 that is divisibleby z2g with Pg(1/4) 6= 0, [z2g]Pg(z) 6= 0 and [zh]Pg(z) = 0 for 0 ≤ h ≤ 2g − 1.Matrix-theory [3, 12], via the Schwinger-Dyson equation or representation theorey[11], connects the generating functions of unicellular, Ug(z), and bicellular maps, Bg(z).The latter counts fatgraphs having two boundary components that are connected as com-binatorial graphs. The relation can also be proved using the representation theoreticthe electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00 1framework of Zagier [14] and is given byg+1∑g1=0Ug1(z)Ug+1−g1(z) +Bg(z) = Ug+1(z)/z. (1.1)Recently [5] the authors presented a bijective proof of the corresponding coefficient equa-tiong+1∑g1=0n∑i≥0ug1(i)ug+1−g1(n− i) + bg(n) = ug+1(n+ 1), (1.2)which revealed a simple construction mechanism. The bijective proof can for instance beapplied, to significantly speed up the folding of RNA interaction structures [6, 1].An analogous relation between unicellular, bicellular and tricellular maps can also beobtained via Matrix-theory. In this paper we give a bijective proof of this relation whichreadsug+2(n + 2) =tg(n) + dg+2(n) + 4ug+2(n + 1)− 3ug+2(n) + (n+ 1)(2n+ 1)ug+1(n),(1.3)where dg+2(n) is explicitly expressed via numbers of unicellular and bicellular maps.Our strategy is to derive a partition of the set of unicellular maps of genus (g + 2)with (n + 2) edges, see Fig. 1 for a first step of how to decompose the latter.U g+2,n+2Ug+2,n+2A Ug+2,n+2BFig. 1: The first step of partition of Ug+2,n+2.It is interesting to note that Matrix-theory does not provide any insight w.r.t. forinstance quadricellular maps. It seems in fact unlikely that such relations can be derivedusing this formal framework. The bijective proof presented here however is rather straight-forward once the correct partitioning is identified. We believe that it is very well possibleto prove similar relations for cellular maps with more than three boundary components.2 Basic DefinitionsLet S2n denote the permutation group over 2n elements.the electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00 2Definition 1. Let k, J be positive integers. A k-cellular map is a triple (H,α, (γi)1≤i≤k),where H is a set of cardinality 2n, α a fixed-point free involution and γi are cycles suchthat γ =∏ki=1 γi ∈ S2n. The elements of H are half-edges, the cycles of α are edges. Thecycles of the permutation σ = α ◦ γ are the vertices vi, 1 ≤ i ≤ J . The length of vi is itsdegree. The cycle γi is the i-th face.The combinatorial graph G of a k-cellular map is the graph whose edges and verticesare the cycles of α and σ. We can regard a G-edge as a ribbon whose two sides arelabeled by the half-edges as follows: each side of the ribbon represents one half-edge, wedecide which half-edge corresponds to which side of the ribbon by the convention that, ifa half-edge h belongs to a cycle e of α and a certain v of σ, then h is the right-hand sideof the ribbon corresponding to e, when entering v. Furthermore, around each vertex v,the counterclockwise ordering of the half-edges belonging to the cycle v is given by thatcycle, we obtain a graphical object called the fatgraph , G, tantamount to (H,α, (γi)i)and the graph G is the corresponding combinatorial graph of G.Definition 2. A planted k-cellular map is a k-cellular map in which each γi contains adistinguished half-edge pi, such that (pi) is a σ-cycle. (pi) is called the plant of the face γiand σ-cycles, except of the plants are called (np)-vertices.In the following, we refer to edges not incident to plants as (np)-edges. Let Xk(n)denote the set of planted k-cellular maps that contain n (np)-edges.In planted maps we shall label the half-edges of H such that (α(pi), pi) = (Ri, Si),that isγ1 = (R1, 1, 2, . . . , m1, S1),γi = (Ri, mi−1 + 1, mi−1 + 2, . . . , mi − 1, mi, Si), 2 ≤ i ≤ k.(2.1)Given xk,n ∈ Xk(n) we define the linear order <γ on H for each face γi via:Si−1 <γ Ri <γ γi(Ri) <γ γ2i (Ri) <γ . . . <γ γmii (Ri) <γ γmi+1i (Ri) = Si.Let furthermore Hγ1,...,γr denote the set consisting the half-edges in one of these γi. Inparticular, Hγi is the set of half-edges contained in the face γi.There is a natural equivalence relation over half-edges, h ∼ α(h) and in particular,α(pi) ∼ pi. If h, α(h) ∈ Hγi, then (h, α(h)) is called a one-sided edge and (h, α(h)) iscalled a two-sided edge, otherwise.For each vertex vj, let minx(vj) denote the first half-edge via which γi enters vj .This gives a canonical way of writing the cycle, starting at h1j = min(vj) namely vj =(h1j , . . . , hnjj ). In particular, the vertex containing the half-edge R1 is v1, the “first” vertex.3 The partition1-cellular maps are also called unicellular maps [4]. Let Ug,n denote the set of planted,unicellular maps of genus g, having n (np)-edges. In particular, let ǫ denote the unicellularthe electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00 3map of genus zero, containing no (np)-edge. This map contains only one edge, the plant,and one additional (np)-vertex.Let ug+2,n+2 = (H,α, γ) ∈ Ug+2,n+2 with face γ = [R1, 1, 2, . . . , 2n + 1, 2n + 2, S1].Thenv1 = (h11, h21, h31 . . . , hm1 ), for some m > 0, (3.1)where h11 = R1. Thus α(h21) = 1 and γ = [R1, α(h21), 2, . . . , 2n + 1, 2n + 2, S1]. In thefollowing we shall identify a partition of Ug+2,n+2 that will facilitate our main bijection inTheorem 1.To begin, we consider for m ≥ 3 the four half edges h21, α(h21), h31 and α(h31). Clearly,α ◦ σ(h21) = α(h31), whence h21 <γ α(h31). Furthermore, by construction,α(h21) <γ h21, α(h21) <γ h31, h21 <γ α(h31),see also Fig. 2. Accordingly, there are the two scenarios(A) α(h21) <γ h21 <γ α(h31) <γ h31 and (B) α(h21) <γ h31 <γ h21 <γ α(h31).The case m = 2 belongs to scenario (A), which then reduces toα(h21) <γ h21.This generates the bipartition of Ug+2,n+2,Ug+2,n+2 = UAg+2,n+2 ∪̇UBg+2,n+2. (3.2)Lemma 1. In UAg+2,n+2-elements the half-edges α(h21) and h21 belong to two different ver-tices, v1 and v2.Proof. We haveα(h21) <γ h21 <γ α(h31) <γ h31,and γ(α(h21)) = h21. Suppose now α(h21) and h21 belong to v1. Then there exists a half-edgeki satisfying γ(ki) = h21 such that h31 <γ ki or h31 = ki, but this implies h31 <γ h21, acontradiction.We next refine UAg+2,n+2: for ug+2,n+2 ∈ UAg+2,n+2, we consider the cycleγ̄ = (α(h21), 2, . . . , h21, α(h31), . . . , h31, h31 + 1, . . . , 2(n+ 1))and we use (α(hi1), hi1), i = 2, 3 to split the γ̄ intoγ̄1 = (α(h21), 2, . . . , h21); γ̄2 = (α(h31), . . . , h31); γ̄3 = (h31 + 1, . . . , 2(n+ 1)), (3.3)see Fig. 2.Suppose the restriction α|S is a welldefined fixed-point free involution, then we call Sclosed. Similarly, the sets Hγ1,...,γr and Hγ̄i , i = 1, 2, 3 are called closed, if α|Hγ1,...,γr andα|Hγ̄i are fixed-point free involutions.the electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00 4g+2,n+2Ua( ) 1h1h1h2a( )1h1ha( )1ha( )1h1h2332233Fig. 2: The three branches (red, blue, black) together with the two pairs (α(h21), h21) and(α(h31), h31).Let U IIg+2,n+2 denote the subset of UAg+2,n+2-elements in which no Hγ̄i is closed and letU Ig+2,n+2 denote its complement. ThenUAg+2,n+2 = UIg+2,n+2 ∪̇UIIg+2,n+2. (3.4)We refine U Ig+2,n+2 further:• U1g+2,n+2: the set of UIg+2,n+2-elements in which exactly two γ̄i, γ̄j are empty,• U2g+2,n+2: the set of UIg+2,n+2-elements in which exactly one γ̄i is empty,• U>2g+2,n+2: the complement of U1g+2,n+2 and U2g+2,n+2, that is, the set of UIg+2,n+2 inwhich no γ̄i is empty.ThusU Ig+2,n+2 = U1g+2,n+2 ∪̇U2g+2,n+2 ∪̇U>2g+2,n+2. (3.5)We refine U>2g+2,n+2 a bit more, for this purpose let• U>2,3g+2,n+2: be the subset of U>2g+2,n+2-elements in which γ̄1 = (α(h21), h21).• U>2,4g+2,n+2: be the subset of U>2g+2,n+2-elements in which γ̄1 = (α(h21), k21, . . . , km1 ),m ≥ 4 and γ̄2 = (α(h31), h31).• U5g+2,n+2: the complement of U>2,3g+2,n+2 and U>2,4g+2,n+2, that is subset of U>2g+2,n+2-elements in which γ̄1 = (α(h21), k21, . . . , km1 ) and γ̄2 = (α(h31), k22, . . . , kl2), m, l ≥ 4.Accordingly,U>2g+2,n+2 = U5g+2,n+2 ∪̇U>2,3g+2,n+2 ∪̇U>2,4g+2,n+2.

These procedures constitute the keythree operations that, applied in various contexts, facilitate the bijection.Lemma 2. (Cutting) Suppose we are given a planted, unicellular map u = (H,α, γ) ∈UAg+2,n+2 withγ = (R1, α(h21), . . . , h21, α(h31), . . . , h31, h31 + 1, . . . , 2(n+ 1), S1). (4.1)Then u can be mapped to a planted, 3-cellular map, x3,n+2 ∈ X3(n + 2), with the threefaces γ1, γ2, γ3 viac2 : UAg+2,n+2 −→ X3(n+ 2),(H,α, γ) 7→ (H,α, (γ1, γ2, γ3))(4.2)whereγ1 = (R1, 1, . . . , m1, S1), γ2 = (R2, m1 + 1, . . . , m2, S2), γ3 = (R3, m2 + 1, . . . , m3, S3).(4.3)Furthermore, the mapping c2 has the following inverse:g2 : X3(n+ 2) −→ UAg+2,n+2(H,α, (γ1, γ2, γ3)) 7→ (H,α, γ).(4.4)the electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00 6Proof. By assumption we haveα(h21) <γ h21 <γ α(h31) <γ h31,whence the face of ug+2,n+2 can be written as in eq. (4.1). We use (α(hi1), hi1), i = 2, 3 andγ̄i, i = 1, 2, 3 which are given by 3.3, then concatenate the sequence of half-edges of (R1),γ̄3 and (S1) to formγ1 = γ̄1, γ2 = γ̄2,γ3 = (R1, h31 + 1, . . . , 2(n+ 1), S1)(4.5)and relabel the cycles as in eq. (4.3). This produces the plants (S1), (S2) and (S3). Since∏3i=1 γi ∈ S2n+2, c2(H,α, γ) is a 3-cellular map, c2 is well-defined, see Fig. 3.U 3Xg+2,n+2 (n+2)1R 2R 3R1S 2S 3SUg+2,n+21R1S1R 1S1R1S 2R2S3R 3S3X (n+2)AAFig. 3: The mappings c2 and g2.We next construct an explicit inverse of c2. Suppose we are given a 3-cellular mapc2((H,α, γ)), in which the γi are as in eq. (4.5). Then we concatenate the sequences of half-edges of the three γi-cycles and relabel as in eq. (4.1), i.e. γ(h21) = α(h31), γ(h31) = h31 + 1and γ(R1) = h31 + 1. We derive, by construction,α(h21) <γ h21 <γ α(h31) <γ h31.Accordingly, g2(c2(H,α, γ)) = (H,α, γ) is a unicellular map of genus (g+2) with property(A).the electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00 7Lemma 3. (Contraction) Suppose u ∈ Ug+2,n+2 has a one-sided edge (α(hl11 ), hl11 ),α(hl11 ) <γ hl11 , such that α(hl11 ) and hl11 are incident to two different vertices vj , v1. Rela-beling the two half-edges we can write the faceγ = (R1, K1, α(hl11 ), K2, hl11 , K3, S1). (4.6)Here either K1 = k11, . . . , kn11 or K1 = ∅, K2 = k12, . . . , kn22 or K2 = ∅ and eitherK3 = k13, . . . , kn33 or K3 = ∅. Then u corresponds to a unicellular map u′ together withtwo distinguished half-edges via mappingm2 : Ug+2,n+2 −→ Ug+2,n+1,((H,α, γ), (α(hl11 ), hl11 )) 7→ ((H′, α′, γ′), (α(hl11 )− 1, hl11 − 1))(4.7)where H ′ = H \\ {hl11 , α(hl11 )}, α′ = α \\ (hl11 , α(hl11 ), γ′ = (R1, K1, K2, K3, S1) and α(hl11 )−1 = kn11 , hl11 − 1 = kn22 , if K1, K2 6= ∅, α(hl11 )− 1 = hl11 − 1 = kn11 , if K1 6= ∅ and K2 = ∅,α(hl11 )− 1 = R1, hl11 − 1 = kn12 , if K1 = ∅ and K2 6= ∅, and finally α(hl11 ) = hl11 = R1, ifK1, K2 = ∅.Furthermore the mapping e2e2 : Ug+2,n+1 −→ Ug+2,n+2,((H ′, α′, γ′), (α(hl11 )− 1, hl11 − 1)) 7→ ((H,α, γ), (α(hl11 ), hl11 ))(4.8)has the property e2 ◦m2 = id.Proof. m2((H,α, γ), (α(hl11 ), hl11 )) is by construction unicellular and retains the genus of(H,α, γ).We describe the contraction in Fig. 4.g+2,n+1Ug+2,n+2U11S2(n+2)1R1h1l1h1la ( )1S1RFig. 4: The mappings m2 and e2. The edge (α(hl11 ), hl11 ) (green) is one-sided edge.the electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00 8Lemma 4. (Deletion) Given a unicellular map u = (H,α, γ) ∈ UBg+2,n+2 with faceγ = (R1, α(h21), K1, h31, K2, h21, α(h31), K3, S1), (4.9)where K1 = k11, . . . , kn11 or K1 = ∅, K2 = k12, . . . , kn22 or K2 = ∅ and K3 = k13, . . . , kn33 orK3 = ∅.Then u corresponds to a unicellular map u′ = (H ′, α′, γ′) ∈ Ug+1,n together with twohalf-edges kl1 and kl2, where kl1 ≤γ kl2, via the mappingr2 : UBg+2,n+2 −→ Ug+1,n((H,α, γ)) 7→ ((H ′, α′, γ′), (kl1 , kl2)),(4.10)where H ′ = H \\ {α(h21), h21, α(h31), h31}, α′ = α \\ {(h21, α(h21)), (h31, α(h31))} andγ′ = (R1, K2, K1, K3, S1). (4.11)r2 can be reversed by mapping a unicellular map u = (H,α′, γ′), together with two arbitraryhalf-edges kl1 and kl2 (kl1 <γ kl2) as follows:s2 : Ug+1,n −→ UBg+2,n+2((H ′, α′, γ′), (kl1 , kl2)) 7→ (H,α, γ).(4.12)Proof. By construction γ′ ∈ S2(n−2), α′ is a fixed-point free involution andH ′ has cardinal-ity 2(n−2), whence r2((H,α, γ)) is unicellular. Euler characteristic implies that the genusof r2((H,α, γ)) is (g − 1). Moreover, we have in case of K1, K2 6= ∅, kl1 = kn11 , kl2 = kn22 ,in case of K1 6= ∅ K2 = ∅, kl1 = kl2 = kn11 , in case of K1 = ∅ and K2 6= ∅, kl1 = R1,kl2 = kn12 , and in case of K1, K2 = ∅ we have kl1 = kl2 = R1, see Fig. 5.Given a unicellular map (H ′, α′, γ′) ∈ Ug+1,n, there are(2n+ 12)+(2n + 11)=(2n+ 1)(2n)2+ 2n+ 1 = (2n+ 1)(n+ 1)ways to choose (kl1 , kl2) such that kl1 <γ kl2. We now select two half-edges (kl1, kl2) suchthat kl1 <γ kl2 and insert the pairs of half-edges (α(hi1), hi1), i = 2, 3 into the face γ′. Thisproduces the face γ, with γ(R1) = α(h21), γ(kl2) = h21, γ(kl1) = h31 and γ(h21) = α(h31),γ(h31) = γ′(R1) and γ(α(h31)) = γ′(kl2). Consequently we haveγ = (R1, α(h21), . . . , kl1 , h31, . . . , kl2, h21, α(h31), . . . , S1).We then relabel γ as in eq. (4.9). Since α is a fixed-point free involution and H is a set ofcardinality 2(n+2), s2(H′, α′, σ′) is a unicellular map with propertyB. Euler characteristicimplies s2(H′, α′, σ′) has genus (g + 2). By construction, we have s2 ◦ r2 = idUBg+2,n+2.the electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00 9lh 1U1Rh21Sa ( )1h21h3a ( )1h3 lh 21R1Slh 1lh 2Ug+1, n1lh 11R1Sa ( )1h2a ( )1h3h211h3lh11R1Slh 1lh 2lh 2g+2, n+21R1Slh 2a ( )1h3a ( )1h2h211h3lh 11R1Slh 2BFig. 5: The mappings r2 and s2.

We furthermoregive in Fig. 6 an modular description of how our bijection works.We call a planted 2-cellular map, whose combinatorial graph is connected, a planted,bicellular map.

Claim 1: The mappingη5,1 : U5,1g+2,n+2 −→⋃̇0≤g3≤g+1, 0≤j,k≤n(Ug3,j ×Bg+1−g3,n−j) ,ug+2,n+2 7→ (ug3,j, bg+1−g3,n−j), 0 ≤ g3 ≤ g + 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ nis a bijection. We first prove that η5,1 is welldefined. For a planted unicellular map(H,α, γ) = ug+2,n+2 ∈ U5,1g+2,n+2 with faceγ = (R1, α(h21), . . . , h21, α(h31), . . . , h31, h31 + 1, . . . , 2(n+ 1), S1),we employ the mapping c2 of the Cutting-Lemma (Lemma 2) in order to decomposeug+2,n+2 into a planted 3-cellular map, x3,n+2 = (H,α, (γi)1≤i≤3), whereγ1 = γ̄1, γ2 = γ̄2,γ3 = (R1, h31 + 1, . . . , 2(n+ 1), S1),(6.1)where γ3 is obtained by concatenating the sequence of half-edges of (R1), γ̄3 and (S1).For any (H,α, γ) = ug+2,n+2 ∈ U5,1g+2,n+2, Hγ̄1 is closed. Since γ1 = γ̄1, the restrictionα|Hγ1 is a fixed-point free involution. Accordingly, (Hγ1, α|Hγ1 , γ1) is a planted unicellularmap.Since Hγ̄2 ∪Hγ̄3 is closed and γi, i = 2, 3 is given in eq. (6.1), the restriction α|Hγ1,γ2is a welldefined fixed-point free involution. Furthermore, since neither Hγ̄2 nor Hγ̄3 areclosed, Hγ2 and Hγ3 are not closed either. Therefore (Hγ1,γ2 , α|Hγ1,γ2 , (γi)1≤i≤2) is a plantedbicellular map with the plants (S1) and (h31).Let ug3,j = (Hγ1 , α|Hγ1 , γ1) and bg′,n′ = (Hγ1,γ2 , α|Hγ1,γ2 , (γi)1≤i≤2).the electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00 13Suppose ug+2,n+2, ug3,j and bg′,n′ have J , Jγ1 and Jb vertices, respectively. Then 2 −2(g + 2) = J − (n+ 2) + 1 and 2− 2g3 = Jγ1 − j + 1, whence2− 2(g + 1− g3) = J − Jγ1 − (n− j) + 2.Since the edges incident to plants and plants do not contribute to the number of edgesand vertices, we have n′ = n − j, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, Jb = J − Jγ1 . As a result bg′,n′ has genus(g + 1− g3), where 0 ≤ g3 ≤ g + 1, whence η5,1 is welldefined.We next show that η5,1 is injective. In order to apply the mapping c2 of the Cutting-Lemma, we introduceζ5,1((Hγ1, α|Hγ1 , γ1), (Hγ1,γ2 , α|Hγ1,γ2 , (γi)1≤i≤2)) = (H,α, (γi)1≤i≤3), (6.2)where γi are given by eq. (6.1), α = α|Hγ1,γ2,γ3 and H = Hγ1 ∪Hγ1,γ2 .For anyη5,1((H,α, γ)) = (ug3,j, bg+1−g3,n−j) ∈⋃̇0≤g3≤g+1, 0≤j,k≤n(Ug3,j × Bg+1−g3,n−j) ,where ug3,j = (Hγ1, α|Hγ1 , γ1), and bg+1−g3,n−j = (Hγ1,γ2 , α|Hγ1,γ2 , (γi)1≤i≤2), we apply ζ5,1.This generates the 3-cellular map (H,α, (γi)1≤i≤3). Since ug3,j has j edges and bg+1−g3,n−jhas (n−j) edges, and the process generates the edges (α(h21), h21) and (α(h31), h31), we havex3,n+2 = (H,α, (γi)1≤i≤3) ∈ X3(n + 2). We can now apply c2 of Lemma 2, which inducesthe mapping c5,1 : X3(n+ 2) −→ U5,1g+2,n+2. Lemma 2 now implies furthermore(c5,1 ◦ ζ5,1) ◦ η5,1 = id,whence the mapping η5,1 is injective.It thus remains to prove that η5,1 is surjective. This follows again from close inspectionof the proof of the Lemma 2, which impliesη5,1 ◦ (c5,1 ◦ ζ5,1) = id.Therefore, η5,1 is surjective and Claim 1 is completed.Analogously we prove that η5,2 and η5,3 are injective.Claim 2: The mappingη5,4 : U5,4g+2,n+2 −→⋃0≤g1,g2≤g+2, 0≤j,k≤nUg1,j × Ug2,k × Ug+2−g1−g2,n−j−k,ug+2,n+2 7→ (ug1,j, ug2,k, ug+2−g1−g2,n−j−k),with 1 ≤ g1, g2 ≤ g + 2 and 1 ≤ j, k ≤ n is a bijection.We first show that η5,4 is well-defined. As in the proof of Claim 1, we employthe Cutting-Lemma which produces a 3-cellular map with the boundary components(γ1, γ2, γ3).the electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00 14For any ug+2,n+2 ∈ U5,4g+2,n+2, each of the Hγ̄i is closed. Thus the restrictions α|Hγi , fori = 1, 2, 3 are welldefined and fixed-point free involutions. As a result, (Hγ1 , α|Hγ1 , γ1),(Hγ1 , α|Hγ2 , γ2) and (Hγ1 , α|Hγ3 , γ3) are unicellular maps, respectively.Let ug1,j = (Hγ1 , α|Hγ1 , γ1), ug2,k = (Hγ2 , α|Hγ2 , γ2) and ug′,n′ = (Hγ3 , α|Hγ3 , γ3). Sup-pose that ug+2,n+2, ug1,j, ug2,k and ug′,n′ have J , Jγ1 , Jγ2 and Jγ3 vertices, respectively.Then2−2(g+2) = J−(n+2)+1, 2−2g1 = Jγ1−j+1, and 2−2g2 = Jγ2−k+1, 1 ≤ j, k ≤ n.(6.3)Furthermore, we haveJ − Jγ1 − Jγ2 − (n− j − k) + 1 = 2− 2(g + 2− g1 − g2).After applying the Cutting-Lemma, (h21) and (h31) become plants, similarly (α(h21), h21) and(α(h31), h31) become edges incident to plants. Thus, we have n′= n − j − k, 0 ≤ j, k ≤ nand Jγ3 = J − 2− Jγ1 − Jγ2 and accordingly obtainJ − 2− Jγ1 − Jγ2 − (n− j − k) + 1 = 2− 2(g + 2− g1 − g1).Consequently, ug′ ,n′ has genus (g + 2 − g1 − g2), where 0 ≤ g1, g2 ≤ g + 2 and η5,4 iswell-defined.We next prove η5,4 is injective. We establish this as in Claim 1, introducingζ5,4 : ((Hγ1 , α|Hγ1 , γ1), (Hγ2, α|Hγ2 , γ2), (Hγ3 , α|Hγ3 , γ3)) 7→ (H,α, (γi)1≤i≤3) (6.4)where γi is given in eq. (6.1), α = α|Hγ1,γ2,γ3 and H = Hγ1 ∪ Hγ1,γ2 . Analogously, c2 ofLemma 2 induces the mapping c5,4 and(c5,4 ◦ ζ5,4) ◦ η5,4 = id,whence the mapping η5,4 is injective.Subjectivity of η5,4 is implied by the Cutting-Lemma which guaranteesη5,4 ◦ (c5,4 ◦ ζ5,4) = id,whence Claim 2 and the proof of the lemma is complete.Proof of Proposition 1.Proof. We prove that the mappingθ : U IIg+2,n+2 −→ Tg,n,ug+2,n+2 7→ tg,n(6.5)is a bijection. As for welldefinedness, suppose ug+2,n+2 ∈ UIIg+2,n+2 whereγ = (R1, α(h21), . . . , h21, α(h31), . . . , h31, h31 + 1, . . . , 2(n+ 1), S1).the electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00 15We use mapping c2 of the Cutting-Lemma and derive the planted 3-cellular map, x3,n+2 =(H,α, (γi)1≤i≤3), whereγ1 = γ̄1, γ2 = γ̄2,γ3 = (R1, h31 + 1, . . . , 2(n+ 1), S1).(6.6)Here γ3 is obtained by concatenating the sequence of half-edges contained in (R1), γ̄3 and(S1).For ug+2,n+2 ∈ UIIg+2,n+2 none of the Hγ̄i, i = 1, 2, 3 is closed, whence the associatedcombinatorial graph of x3,n+2 is connected. Accordingly, x3,n+2 = θ(ug+2,n+2) is a plantedtricellular map with plants (h21), (h31) and (S1). Euler’s characteristic formula implies tg,nhas genus g and n edges, whence θ is well-defined. Injectivity and surjectivity of θ areimplied by the Cutting Lemma.Proof of Lemma 6.Proof. Claim 1: The mappingη1 : U1g+2,n+2 −→ Ug+2,n+1,((H,α, γ), (α(h21), h21)) 7→ ((H′, α′, γ′), (α(h21)− 1, h21 − 1)).(6.7)is a bijection.The contraction lemma implies that η1 is welldefined. Injectivity of η1 follows by con-sidering the mapping ρ1 induced by the mapping e2 of Lemma 3, where ρ1((H′, α′, γ′)) =(H,α, γ) ∈ U1g+2,n+2. Lemma 3 guarantees ρ1 ◦η1 = id, whence η1 is injective. Surjectivityof η1 is a consequence of η1 ◦ ρ1 = id, implied by Lemma 3, see Fig. 7.1Sg+2,n+1U1Rg+2,n+2U11S1R1h21ha ( )2Fig. 7: The mapping η1 and the one-sided edge (α(h21), h21)) (green).The proof that ηj : Ujg+2,n+2 −→ Ug+2,n+1 is a bijection for j = 2, 3, 4 follows analo-gously, see Fig. 8.The proof of Lemma 7.the electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00 16(a) (b)g+2,n+2U3g+2,n+1U(a) (b)g+2,n+2U2g+2,n+2U4(a) (b)h 2h 3h 4g+2,n+1UFig. 8: The mappings η2, η3 and η4.Proof. Claim 1: The mappingη5 : Um,1g+2,n+2 −→ Ug+2,n,((H,α, γ), (α(h21), h21), (α(h31), h31)) 7→ ((H′, α′, γ′), (α(h21)− 1, h21 − 1), (α(h31)− 1, h31 − 1))(6.8)is a bijection.We first prove that η5 is welldefined. Consider (H,α, γ) ∈ Um,1g+2,n+2 together with twoone-sided edges, (α(h21), h21), (α(h31), h31), such that h11 and h21 are incident to v1, α(h11) andα(h21) are incident to vi and vj .We then apply Lemma 3 to a (H,α, γ) ∈ Um,1g+2,n+2 together with the one-side edge(α(h21), h21). We iterate applying Lemma 3 w.r.t. the edge (α(h31), h31). By definition ofLemma 3 this generates the unicellular map (H ′, α′, γ′) of genus (g + 2) having n edgeswith distinguished four half-edges α(h21)− 1, h21 − 1, α(h31)− 1 and h31 − 1.Since Lemma 3 preserves genus, η5((H,α, γ)) has genus (g + 2) and n edges, whenceη5 is well-defined.We next prove η5 is injective. Suppose we have a unicellular map (H′, α′, γ′) ∈ Ug+2,nwith four distinguished half-edges α(h21)−1, h21−1, α(h31)−1 and h31−1. We observe thatthe mapping m2 constructed in Lemma 3 allows us to obtain a mapping ρ5 : Ug+2,n →Um,1g+2,n+2 such thatρ5 ◦ η5 = id,the electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00 17whence injectivity.Surjectivity follows by computing η5 ◦ ρ5 = id.The proof thatη6 : Um,2g+2,n+2 −→ Ug+2,n and η7 : Um,3g+2,n+2 −→ Ug+2,nare bijections is analogous, see Fig. 9.g+2,n+2Um,1h 5h 7g+2,nUg+2,n+2Um, 2g+2,n+2Um, 3h 6Fig. 9: The mappings η5, η6 and η7.The proof of Proposition 2.Proof.

        "abstract": "The primary goal of heavy ion physics is the study of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). In this exotic state of matter, the quarks and gluons, which make up ordinary hadronic matter, decouple and behave as free particles. The QGP exists at extremely high temperatures and baryon densities, for example, in the early universe or in the ultra-dense core of neutron stars. The thermal radiation from the quarks in the plasma can provide direct information on the temperature evolution and, hence, on the equation of state of the QGP. To isolate these thermal photons, precise knowledge is required on alternative sources of photon production in hadronic collisions. This was the principle argument to study the production rates of direct photons in p+p and d+Au collisions. In this thesis, we present the first direct photon measurement with the STAR detector at RHIC. The data were obtained from p+p and d+Au collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 200 GeV per nucleon pair. The cross sections of neutral pion and direct photon production in p+p collisions are in agreement with the results from perturbative QCD calculations. The nuclear modification factor of neutral pion production in d+Au collisions is consistent with unity for transverse momenta ranging from 2 GeV/c up to 15 GeV/c, indicating the absence of strong nuclear effects. In general, the techniques and results presented in this thesis constitute a solid baseline for a future analysis of thermal photon production in Au+Au collisions.",

On the kpc scale, the star-formation rate seems to be proportional to some power of the gas density (Schmidt law), although it is not yet established whether the law is linear or not. In any case, the star-formation rate will be enhanced in regions where a large amount of gas can be concentrated, and dynamical perturbations able to drive significant gas flows will trigger starbursts. Galaxy-galaxy interactions, spiral density waves and bars are all susceptible to enhance cloud-cloud collisions, to gather the gas in dense regions, and to produce radial gas flows at different degrees, and therefore have been advocated as large-scale triggers of star-formation. The author first reviews briefly the observational evidence of this triggering, then describe the relevant simulations of interacting and barred galaxies that account for this triggering. The dynamical mechanisms producing enhanced star-formation and radial gas flows are then discussed.",

ABSTRACT We discuss in this paper, the main properties ofthe family ofstar clusters in the large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). To this aim, we first review the stellar models for low and intermediate mass stars in occurrence ofconvective overshoot, and then describe an algorithm suitable for a theoretical approach to cluster photometry (colour magnitude C—M) diagrams, luminosity functions (LF), integrated magnitudes and colours, and total masses). The Johnson B—V CCD photometry of the stellar content of NGC 1866 is presented and used to test the theoretical models for intermediate mass stars with convective overshoot. The conclusion of this analysis is that these models fit the C— M diagram and LF of NGC 1866 much better than any other type of models in the literature. In addition to this, the Johnson B—V CCD photometry ofNGC 183 1, another populous cluster of LMC, is presented and analyzed by means of the same stellar models. In particular, we discuss the effect of unresolved binary stars on alleviating the discrepancy between the age determined from the main sequence stars and the age determined from the red giant stars. Following an idea advanced by Eggen and Iben (1988, 1989) to explain the existence of blue stragglers in young disk aggregates, we explore the possibility that delayed star formation has taken place in NGC 1831. The final part of the review deals with the integrated photometry of star clusters. Theoretical calibrations between integrated colours and age as a function ofthe chemical composition, are briefly discussed. The aim is to derive the age distribution function of LMC cluster and interpret the physical cause of their bimodal distribution in (B—V). The main result is that bimodality simply originates from the kind of age distribution that LMC clusters happen to possess, whereas all other explanations put forward in literature play a marginal role. We also present new estimates of the total mass of many clusters derived from their integrated B—V magnitudes. Finally a few words are addressed to the issue of the history of star formation in the field stars of LMC.

Introduction In this paper we report on a series of studies aimed at interpreting in a coherent fashion the properties of star clusters in LMC. To this purpose. on one hand we have undertaken an observational program to determine the Johnson BVRI CCD photometry for a large sample of clusters spanning the whole range of ages and chemical composition. on the other hand we have calculated many evolutionary tracks in the mass range 0.6 to 9 M0 and with different chemical compositions, which have been followed from the main sequence till the latest evolutionary phases. The observational material is used to derive for each cluster the C—M diagram, the luminosity functions, the surface brigthness photometry, and the integrated magnitudes and colours. The theoretical models provide an homogeneous background from which the above observational properties can be derived as a function of the age, chemical composition, initial mass function, etc. The paper is organized in three parts. In the first one, the main properties of stellar models are outlined and our theoretical approch to cluster photometry is described. The second part deals with the stellar contents of two clusters, namely NGC 1866 and NGC 1831. NGC 1866 is taken as a template cluster against which stellar models can be compared and their reliability can be tested. The analysis of NGC 1866 indicates that stellar models with convective overshhot ought to be preferred, whereas the study on NGC 1831 brings into evidence the important role played by unresolved binary stars, and also suggests the possibility that star formation has occurred either on a relatively long time scale or in a series of episodes, not excluding however the possibilty that the cluster itself might be the result of merging of smaller subunits. In the third part. we address the issue of the integrated photometry (magnidutes and colours) and of their dependence on age and chemical composition. New calibrating relationships are are presented, which in principle enable us to estimate the age of a cluster from its integrated colours. We also discuss the nature of the bimodal distribution in (B-V) exhibited by LMC clusters, pointing out that the age distribution function (the final result of the cluster formation and disruption histories) is the main parameter determing the observed (B-V) colour distribution. In addition to this, we present preliminary results of a study aimed at deriving the total mass of any cluster from its integrated magnitude. Finally. we briefly report on a study on the law of star formation underlying the C—M diagrams and luminosity function of stellar fields in LMC. In principle, if we are able to determine the efficiency of star (and likely cluster) formation in LMC, subtracting it from the age distribution, we may be also able to infer something on the efficiency of cluster disruption by various dynamical processes all over the galaxian lifetime. 2. Review of Stellar Evolution with Convective Overshoot In the classical view of stellar evolution, semiconvection caused by the high radiation pressure and electron scattering opacity affects the mass extention of convective cores of massive stars, during both core H and He-burning phase, whereas a similar phenomenon, driven by the opacity difference between carbon-rich and carbon poor-mixtures affects those of intermediate and low mass stars, however limited to the core He-burning phase. These topics have been the subject of many theoretical studies (see the review articles by Chiosi l’986) and are still a matter of a vivid debate. However, in addition to the problem of semiconvection. there is a more fundamental question concerning the mass extension of convective cores, i.e. the amount of convective overshoot from their borders. This, in fact, is always expected to occur at the boundary of a convective core, where the kinetic energy of convective elements carries them a finite distance into layers which are formally stable against convection. Though simply motivated from the standpoint of physical arguments, great controversy exists on the exact amount of convective overshoot. According to the theoretical formulations of this phenomenon proposed by different authors, the overshoot distance at the edge of the formally convective core goes from zero to about 2 pressure scale heights (see Chiosi 1986 for a review of the subject and exhaustive referencing). In any case, convective overshoot gives rise in stellar models to differences in structure and evolution that are much more substantial than those given by semiconvection. In addition to the above arguments of mere theoretical nature, there are many observational facts requiring a deep revision of the basic physics, such as convective cores significantly bigger than usually assumed (see the discussion by Bertelli et al. 1985, l986a,b; Bressan et al 1986; Maeder and Meynet 1988). 2.1 Stellar Models with Convective Overshoot Among the possible formulations of convective overshoot, we adopt the method developed by Bressan et al. (1981), which stands on a non local view of convection, uses the mixing length theory, and takes the mean free path of convective elements as a parameter to be fixed by STAR CLUSTERS IN THE LMC 127 comparing model results with the observational properties of star clusters. The mean free path iS given by 1 ~AHp. where Hp is the loca] pressure scale height and A is a free parameter. The evolutionary models we are going to describe are for A = 1. which has been found to give the most interesting results (Bertelli et al. 1985: 1986a,b: Bressan et al. 1986). 1) The Core H-Burning Phase Stars whose initial mass is high enough to develop a convective core on the main sequence (M >1.1 M9), are strongly affected by convective overshoot. In fact, owing to their more massive convective cores, they run at higher luminosities and live longer than classical models. They also extend the main sequence band over a wider range of effective temperatures. this trend increasing with the stellar mass. Massive stars (M > 40 M9) would spread all across the colour— magnitude (CM) diagram. were it not for the contrasting effect of mass loss (see Chiosi and Maeder 1986). 11) The Core He-Burning Phase in Massive and Intermediate Mass Stars The overluminosity caused by overshoot during the core H-burning phase still remains during the shell H- and core He-burning phases. The mass of the H-exhausted core. M11e• and the mass of the C-O rich, He-burning convective core, are increased by overshoot. However. as a consequence of the higher luminosity, the lifetime of the He—burning phase (ta) gets shorter in spite of the increase in the core mass. This, combined with the longer H-burning lifetime. tH~ makes the ratio tH/tH fairly low (from 0.12 to 0.06 when the stellar m~ss varies from 1.6 to 9 M0). The location of the core He-burning models in the CM diagram can be schematically summarized as follows. In massive stars. where mass loss all over the stellar life dominates, the He—burning phase takes place entirely in the blue for M > 60 M0. partly in the blue and partly in the red for stars in the range 60 to 20 M~ or thereabouts. the lifetime of the two sub—phases being controlled by the mass loss rate. The blue loops of intermediate mass stars (M < MUF) are much less extended, whereas their dependence on chemical composition and nuclear reaction rates is the same as in classical models. This implies that the blue band of core He—burning models is less inclined in the HR diagram and. therefore, for a given chemical composition the intersection with the instability strip occurs at different luminosities, hence masses. iii) The Core He-Burning Phase of Low Mass Stars HB stars while burning helium in the centre, possess a convective core whose mass extension may be affected by convective overshoot. Models of HB stars have been calculated according to the Bressan et al. (1981) algorithm with A = 1. core mass equal to 0.475 M and total mass in the range 0.6 to 1.4 M0 (Bressan et al. 1986). The most important result ~? these calculations is that in presence of convective overshoot, semiconvection and/or breathing pulses of convection (see Castellarii et al. 1985 for details) never develop. In particular, these models predict lifetime ratios in RGB, HB and AGB that are in closer agreement with the observational ones derived from star counts in globular clusters (see Buonanno et al. 1985, for a discussion of this topic). A detailed description of these models and a comparison with the observational data for globular clusters are given in Bressan et al. (1986) to whom we refer. Iv) The Critical Masses M . M and M . mas up HeF By virtue of the larger masses of the lie and C-O core left over at the end of core H and Heburning phases respectively, the relationships between the initial mass and the mass of the He and C-U core. which define the critical masses in question are different in models with convective overshoot. The most important result is that now both M and MH F are significantly lower than in classical models. They turn out to be about 1.5 smal~t~r than ~n classical models. This means that no AGB and no prolonged RGB phases are expected for stars of initial mass above the new Mu and MHp~ respectively. The impact of this result on the observational front is straightforw~rd and or a paramount importance. v) The AGB Phase Over the past few years, the evolution of AGB stars has been the subject of a great deal of theoretical studies recently reviewed by Lattanzio (1988a) aimed at understanding why carbon stars can be formed at lower luminosities than predicted by the classical models of Iben (l975a.b, 1976; Becker 1981; Becker and Iben 1979). Since the evolution along the .thermally pulsing AGB phase is essentially governed by the linear relationship between the H-exhausted core mass, or equivalently the C-O core mass, and the luminosity (see Iben and Renzini 1983 for all details), this is equivalent to say that the third dredge up must operate at lower core masses than suggested by the current theory. The series of recent models by Lattanzio (1986. l987a. l987b, l988a,b, 1989), Boothroyd and Sackmann (l988a—d) and Hollowell (1987, 1988) in 128 C. CHIOSI the mass range 1-3 M0, in which revised algorithms for semiconvection and breathing convection. the use of better opacities, the inclusion of mass loss by stellar wind. and the estimate of the dependence of the C-O core mass at the first thermal pulse on the initial chemical composition and initial mass of the star, concur to succeed in producing models of carbon stars of quite low luminosity. Models incorporating convective overshoot (see Chiosi et al. . 1987) have not yet been evolved into the thermally pulsing regime, however we may foresee that they should give simi1ar results, since they share many features in common with models calculated with semiconvection and breathing convection. Among other things, since they predict that M is much lower than the classical value, this would help removing all very bright AGB stars indicated by the observational data (very few AGB stars brighter than Mb = —6). 3. The Theoretical Approach to the Cluster Photometry Starting from the models described in the previous section. a numerical code can be developed, which generates: i) Synthetic HR diagrams, in which stars are distributed along a given isochrone according to evolutionary lifetimes and initial mass function (IMF). For the IMF we use the Salpeter (1955) law according to which the number of stars dN in the mass interval dm is given by dN = th(M) dM, (1) —(1+x) . . . . . where ~(M) = A M . The constant A is fixed by the normalization condition NT A ML ~ dM . (2) where NT 1S the total number of stars in a cluster, whereas ML and M~ are the minimum and maximum mass of stars allowed to form in each stellar generation. Star formation is supposed to take place either instantaneously or over a finite time period, which introduces an age spread among the stars present in a cluster of any age. A gaussian distribution with a width a is assumed for the age dispersion. Finally, at any given age only stars up to a maximum mass M(t) can exist along the isochrone, which is supposed to include stars from the main sequence till the latest observable stage, namely before either the final explosion and/or the formation of a collapsed remnant, depending on the initial mass (cf. Renzini 1981. and Renzini and Buzzoni 1986 for more details). This makes the total number NT(t) of living stars in a cluster a decreasing function of the age. In practice a “Monte Carlo” technique is employed, which randomly distributes stars of fixed age and age dispersion along all possible evolutionary stages. All values of the stellar mass in the range ML to M(t) are allowed, each of which weighed on the IMF. The procedure is repeated until the-number of stars has grown to NT(t). Since under any plausible IMF, main sequence stars are by far more numerous than those in post main sequence stages and ML is fairly small (0.1 M0 or thereabouts), this way of proceeding is not very convenient, as an enormous number of trials would be required. On the other hand, observations of real clusters with nowadays instrumentation customarily provide data only for stars of the upper main sequence and later evolutionary stages. Even worse, in many cases only the brightest evolved, stars can be seen. In the light of this, we prefer to replace condition (2) with the equivalent one that a fixed number of post main sequence stars NPMS (blue and red giants and AGB’s) is matched. The total number of living stars in a synthetic cluster follows from integrating relation (I) from M(t) down to ML. In addition to this, the “Monte Carlo” technique we have adopted both for the mass and age distribution along a given isochrone has the advantage over similar simulations of stellar clusters that stochastic effects in the IMF are automatically taken into account (see also Becker and Mathews 1983). This effect may be particularly important in connection with short lived, yet very bright, evolutionary stages, like the AGB phase. We will touch upon this point later on. iii) Integrated fluxes and colours. If the Mv~ MB and Mu magnitudes of each star of the synthetic cluster are known, the integrated magnitudes and colours immediately follow from summing up the fluxes of the component stars. The integrated flux in a given passband is expressed by F~ ~ ~(M1) io_04 MAA (M~,t) AM (3) STAR CLUSTERS IN THE LMC 129 where M~,,(M. ,t) is the magnitude of a star of mass M. at time t. MI normalization factors entering ‘th~ definition of ~(M) and FA are not of interest here. The integrated colours are computed with the relations (see Searle et al. 1973) (B-V) = 2.5 Lo~(F~/F~) and (U--B)0 ~ 2.5 Lo~(F8/F~). (4) Similar expressions hold good in the case of an isochrone with a continuous distribution of stars (masses), provided the summation is replaced by an integral and M~2(M.,t) is considered as the magnitude in the pass band t\\2 of the particular stage along the isochrone to which a mass M. corresponds.

In both cases, the actual total magnitudes are given by M~A -2.5 Log(A F~). (5) v) Luminosity functions for the main sequence and the evolved stars. These turn out to be very very useful tools for discriminating among the various scenarios for the evolution of stars of any mass that have been proposed during the recent years (see section 1). 3.1 The Conversion to a Colour-Magnitude Diagram The theoretical luminosities and effective temperatures are translated into Mv. MB~ Mu magnitudes and (B—V), (U-B)0 colours using tables of conversion, where colours and bolometric corrections are given as a function of the effective temperature (Tff) and gravity (g). There are two main sets of Tables, i.e. the ones elaborated by Chiosi et al. (1988), which are based on model atmospheres calculatedby several authors (Bel] and Gustafsson 1978; Buser and Kurucz 1978; Gustafsson et al. 1975) and extend to the UBV passbands, and those contained in the revised Yale isochrones (Green et al. 1987) which extends to the UBVRI passbands. Though similar, they differ in several details which may bear some importance in tht comparison with the observational data. Results will be presented for both sources. 4. Clusters of the LMC: NGC 1866 a Test for Convective Overshoot Although stellar models calculated with semiconvection and breathing convection look similar to th•se calculated with convective overshoot, the two types of model deeply differ in many &!uantitative details. The characterizing features are the core H and He-burning lifetimes and evolutionary brightening from the main sequence up to the most advanced stages. These should immediately reflect into the morphology of CM diagrams of star clusters, namely the number of evolved to main sequence stars and associated luminosity functions. It goes without saying that the ideal laboratory where theories of stellar structure, in particular those concerning the domain of massive and intermediate mass stars, can be tested are the rich young clusters of the Magellanic Clouds. These in fact by virtue of their large number of stars allow statistically meaningful comparisons between theory and observations in samples of about coeval and chemically homogeneous objects even for the shortest lived evolutionary stages. To this purpose, Chiosi et al. (1988a,b) have taken accurate Johnson BV CCD photometry of the cluster NGC 1866 of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and compared its CM diagram and main sequence star luminosity function with the theoretical predictions based on both classical models and models with convective overshoot. The results of Chiosi’s et al. (1988a,b) study are briefly summarized below. NGC 1866 is a rich young cluster situate~ at about 2° North of the LMC centre, whose total mass is estimated in the range 3.6 to 8.5 10 M (Heckman 1976). It is classified as a type III in the Searle et al. (1980) system, with in~egrated apparent visual magnitude V = 9.73, and colours (B—V) = 0.25 and (U-B) = —0.04 (van den Bergh 1981) and colour excess E(B—V) = 0.07 (Persson et al. 1983). Johnson BV CCD photometry of 1517 stars in the central region of NGC 1866, and of 640 stars in a nearby field have been obtained with the RCA #5 CCD at 2.2m ESO telescope and reduced using the ESO version of DAOPHOT. To define the region of the cluster frame that suffers from the least degree of uncertainty by photometric incompleteness and contamination by field stars the following procedure is adopted. First, a composite CCD frame (cluster and field) is obtained superposing a few bright stars in common. and an iterative procedure is used to fix the cluster centre. Second, the surface brightness profile of the cluster is generated in a way similar to Meylan and Djorgovski (1987) and compared to the theoretical density profiles calculated from multi—mass, Ki~ig-Michie models (Meylan 1987a,b: 1988) in the case of the Salpeter law with slope x = 2.35 and isotropical velocity dispersion. 130 C. CHIOSI The cluster turns out to possess a concentration c = log r~/r = 1.5, a core radius r = 6.69 and a tidal radius r~ = 211. “6. Furthermore. since the last ~ o~ the observed pro~ile is at about r = 2.40 to which a density contrast of about a factor of 10 corresponds, the radius r~ = 2.45 is taken as the limiting radius beyond which the majority of stars are field objects. Third, the surface brightness profi1e is reconstructed from the photometric data (V and/or B magnitudes) of individual stars falling within circles of increasing radius centerd on the cluster centre. The simultaneous comparison of the surface brightness profi1e, the density profile, and the surface brightness profile reconstructed from individual stars, shows that the ring confined between 0. 52 and 0. ‘98 is the one suffering from the least degree of incompleteness by crowding and other causes, and it can be taken to represent the cluster population. The CM of the stars falling in this region is assumed as the reference.CM to which theoretical models ought to be compared. This is shown in Fig.l. In this CM diagram. three regions of particular interest can be defined, nam&ly: the region of the main sequence stars (MS), the region of red giant stars brigther than 17 V mag (BRGS), the region of red giant stars fainter than 17 V mag (FRGS). The total number of stars is 656, of which MS = 594, BRGS = 39 and FRGS = 23. This CM diagram is photometrically complete down to V = 19.2 mag. The field is given by the region of the composite CCI) frame outside r~. whose area happens to be nearly identical to that of the cluster ring. After correction for photometric completeness (crowding) and contamination by fie’d stars by means of the zapping technique of Mateo and lodge (1986), the total number of stars is 1020 made of MS = 954, BRGS = 41.

The integrated luminosity function for the main sequence stars normalized to the number of bright red giant stars (V < 17 nag) likely representing the evolved counterpart of the main sequence population (see text for more details), likely represents the population of evolved stars belonging to the cluster, i.e. genetically linked to the populations of MS, whereas FGRS are likely field stars. NGC 1866 contains also several Cepheids: 11 well established objects (Walker 1987, and references therein) and about 10 more recent candidates (Storm et al. 1988), which are located in the middle of BRGS. The sample of BRGS can be split into three subgroups (labeled A, B and C). Group A and B contain almost equal numbers of stars and are located at the blue and red side of the instability strip, whereas group C is populated by stars (very few indeed) of the same luminosity but of much redder colour. Likely, these do not belong to the same population as those of groups A and B, but probably they are genetically related to FRGS. The luminosity function for the MS stars is presented in Fig.2.

CHIOSI sequence band is M = —0.32, whereas the luminosity at the bottom of the ciump of red stars is Mv 0.28. These Ywo critical ‘uminosities can be used to set a preliminary estimate of the age (Chiosi et al 1988). It is soon evident that, independently of the adopted chemical composition and conversion relations, the age estimated from the main sequence ~ termination Magnitude is in contrast with the age derived from the clump of red stars. Looking at the simulated C-M diagrams (Yale conversions) and the colour trend of the main sequence band, and taking into account the colour exgess~ we notice that metallicities as low as Z = 0.001, which would imply an age of about 5x10 yr, can be excluded as the theoretical main sequence turns out to be much bluer and at the same time the bulk of red giants to be at least 1.5 mag brighter than the observgd ones. On the other hand, metallicities as high as Z = 0.02, for which an age of about 8x10 yr is found, can also be excluded as, if the termination magnitude of the main sequence band and marginally the bottom luminosity of the red giants can be matched, they both turn out to be much redder than the observed ones. In the case of the metallicity Z = 0.004, the main sequence bands agree both in luminosity and colour, but the predicted red giants are about 0.5 mag brighter than thg observed ones though of about the same colour. The age in this case is approximately 8x10 yr. Therefore, if we impose the constraint that the termination magnitude and colour trend of the main sequence are matched, 14 16 16 20 22 1.5 2 2.5 —.5 0 .5 (B—V) 1.5 2 2.5 Fig.3 The reference C—M diagrams for the annulus of NGC 1831.

The percentage of unresolved binaries amounts to 30% and their mass ratio Q = M1I~2 is the range 0.8 to 1.25 difficulties arise in reproducing the luminosity and colour of the red giants or, conversely, in reconciling their age with that of main sequence stars. Similar results are obtained with the Chiosi et al. (1988) conversions, although different ages a-e derived. There are several causes for the disagreement between the expected and observed location of red giants with respect to the termination magnitude of the main sequence~ band, among which we recall: 1) inadequacy of the conversion relationships; ii) inadequacy of the relationships converting luminosities and effective temperatures into visual magnitudes and (B—V) colours;liii III NGC 1831 — lOOSRS25Opxl selected —4 - . .~.

Points (1) through (iii) are found to yield a marginal effect, whereas points (iv) and (v) may be more important. In the following we will discusss these two latter points in some detail. Stellar Models. The stellar models in use are those with convective overshoot during the core H and He—burning phases. It has been already said that among other properties, these models are known to predict different H and He-burning lifetimes and much higher luminosities during these two phases with respect to classical models (Becker 1981; Castellani et al. 1985; Lattanzio 1986, 1989; Mazzitelli and DAntona 1986; Chieffi and Straniero 1988). In particular, in the mass range we are interested in, the luminosity of the core He—burning phase (loop or clump) is higher than the tip luminosity of the main sequence band, whereas in classical models this difference in the luminosity of the two types of star is much less pronounced. Since this is exactly the kind of models we would need to alleviate the above discrepancy, we might be tempted to conclude that classical models should used instead of those with convective overshoot. Howeve~, the studies by Barbaro and Pigatto (1984) on red giants in clusters younger than about 2—3x10 yr, by Becker and Mathews (1983) and Chiosi et al. (l989a,b) on star counts and luminosity functions of NGC 1866, and the recent analysis of the obervational hints in favour of convective overshoot by Maeder and Meynet (1988), point out that classical models can hardly reproduce the observational data and all conclude that models with convective offer better possibilities, even though the effiency of this phenomenon is still a matter of vivid debate. Another point of controversy may reside in the opacity, and in particular its variations across different areas of the C—M diagram. The comparison with models in literature (Mazzitelli and DAntona 1986: Castellani et al. 1985; Lattanzio 1986, 1989) is not conclusive in this respect as they are calculated with substantially different physics (seminconvection versus overshoot), whereas models of ours with convective overshoot and other opacities are not presently available. Perhaps all this is suggesting that other more subtle causes are the reason of the discrepancy in question. Binary Stars. The occurrence of binaries among main sequence stars may not be marginal as, under suitable combination of the mass ratio. they contribute to spread the main sequence band, shift toward brighter magnitude its termination stage, and alter the luminosity function. As already reported, we can explicitly include binary stars in our synthetic C-M diagrams following the procedure proposed long ago by Maeder (1974). The effect of binary stars depends On the assumed distribution of mass ratios. If the mass ratio is close to one, a second sequence about 0.7 magnitude brighter than the sequence of single stat’s is generated. As the range of mass ratios is let increase, the main sequence band is scattered by at most 0.7 magnitudes at any given colour. This means, in particular, that the main sequence tip is shifted to 0.7 brighter magnitudes, and therefore the real termination magnitude fixing the age must b~ taken 0.7 mag below the observed one. For Z = 0.004 this corresponds to an age of l.04x10 yr. The fraction of binary stars is taken to amount to 30% and the mass ratio Q = M1/M2 1S assumed in the range 0.8 to 1.25. With the inclusion of the binary stars, the apparent main sequence termination magnitude is as bright as ~ = -0.3 in agreement with the observational determination, the red giant stars are fainter since they older than in the previoulsy fixed by the termination magnitude, and finally the red stars are scattered toward bluer colours as it occurs in the observational C-M diagram. Finally, Fig.4 shows a complete simulation of the C-M diagram of NGC 1831 in which the effects o. binary stars and photometrical errors estimated by Vallenari et al. (1989) are included. This C—M diagram remarkably resembles the observational one of Fig.3. however even in this case, although the magnitude difference between the apparent tip of the main sequence and the red stars has almost entirely disappeared, the bulk giants tend to be about 0.3 mag brighter than the observed ones. More important, when binary stars are considered, the apparent tip of the main sequence can no longer be taken as a firm age indicator. 5.2 Fits of the Cluster Luminosity Function The integrated luminosity functions for the C—M diagrams that formally match the termination magnitude of the main sequencg band are shown in Fig.5, together with the ob~ervational one. These are for the age of 8x10 yr with no binaries and for the age of l.04x10 yr and 30% of 134 C. CHIOSI Fig.5 The integrated 1urninosi~itv functions (hF), normalized to - N = 125, for the C-M diagrams matched the termiimtion magnitude of the math sequence: age 8x18 yr and no binaries and 1.04x10 yr and binaries as indicated. This latter :is given for two slopes of the initial mass function. namely x = 1.35 and x ~ 0.35. The observat.ion0i rr~F is also shown. The observational ILF is normalized to NBRGS ~ 130. required by the observational data. It is worth recalling errors does not appreciably alter the luminosity function Although we may be tempted to conclude that the age of 1.04x109 yr the metallicity Z = 0.004 are the appropriate parameters for the cluster, in that the termination magnitude of the main sequence and the luminosity function of these stars are reproduced, there still remains the disagreement between observed and expected location of the red giants. Considering the entity of the discrepancy in question, we may argue that suitable adjustments of the colour equation, conversion re1ations,~’ extinction, and adopted stellar models (in particular the effect of higher opacities) could entirely account for the above discrepancy. However, we would like to call the attention to the broad scatter at the tip of the main sequence band (Fig.3), which cannot be reproduced by our simulations of the C—M diagram even when the effects by photometrical errors are taken into account (Fig.4). Among the many factors affecting the appearence of a star cluster’s CM diagram, dispersion in age, if substantial, can easily contribute to scatter stars about the tip of the main sequence and in the region of red giants. 5.3 Prolonged Activity of Star Formation ? Interpreting the C—M diagram of a cJuster the assumption is customarily made that all stars are formed in a single episode of activity spanning a narrow age range, so that all stars are essentially coeval and an unique isochrone can be adopted to date any cluster. This basically stands on the notion that once stars with masses all over the mass spectrum are born and the first generation of supernovae (massive) has occured, all remaining gas is blown away from the cluster potential well, so that no further star formation taken place. Since the typical lifetime of a massive supernova progenitor is short (several 10 yr at most) the process of star formation in a cluster is considered to be sharply confined in time and, therefore, as soon as the stellar content gets older, the dispersion in the star ages to be negligible compared to the mean age of the population. However, the possibility has been suggested that star formation in stellar aggregates may take place over extended periods of time, often in recurrent bursts of activity (Eggen and Iben 1988, 1989). Exploiting further Eggen and Iben’ binaries included (the C--M diagram of this latter is shown in Fig4). Both cases have been calculated assuming NPMS 125 as indicated by star counts in the observational CM diac~rwn of Fig.3. The comparison with the the observational ILF. based on the assumed distance modulus and extinction, reveals that the case with age of i.04xI0 yr, the Sa.lpeter law, and 30% of unresolved binaries fits the data very well, The case with the same age and percentage of binaries but flatter initial mass function (x 0.35) would predict a similar C--M (Ilagram but a 8 6 4 2 0 —1 Crj 0, z z flatter that the but only V ILF, which seems not to be inclusion of photometrical scatter the (B-V) colour. STAR CLUSTERS IN THE LMC 135 (1988, 1989) suggestion, we have tried to investigate whether this idea could be applied to NGC 1831 to ameliorate the interpretation of its C-M diagram and luminosity function. To this aim we have simulated many C—M diagrams at varying law of star formation. These sirnuThtions are obtained imposing that the termination magnitude and the mean colour of the main sequence band, together with the luminosities and coiours of the red giant stars are matched at a time. Furthermore, the effects of binary stars and photometrical errors are also included.9 We find that all of the above constraints are compatible with ages in the range 0.8-i .4x1O yr and metallicitiy Z = 0.004. Binary stars are assumed to amount to 30% of the total. and their presence is meanly meant to account for the spread of red giants toward bluer colours seen in the observational C-M diagram, As for the law of star formation, the many experiments we have performed to this purpose show that assuming it either constant or declining toward the present by a factor of two to three with respect to the initial value, yield simulations that almost perfectly match the C--M diagram and hF of main sequence stars of NGC 1831 . The CM dia~rain and ILF for the case with constant star formation rate are shown in Fig.6 and Fig.7, reseectively. These have been obtained imposing the same number of post~ main sequence stars as in the observational sample of data, We learn frOm our simulations that, if a prolonged activity of star formation is allowed to occur, the best fit. with the observational data is obtained when the slope of the initial mass function is decreased to x = 0.35, Tn such a a case. the theoretical C-M diagram and JLF are both indistinguishible from the observationaj ones. The possibility of several bursts of activity cannot be excluded as they would 8lead to similar results provided they have occurred within the time interval of about Gxi() yr. The above simulations have been obtained assuming the same metallicity all over the period spanned by the star forming activity. Simulations (not shown here), in which various bursts of star formation, each one with a different metallicity [form Z ~ 0.001 (the lowest in our sets of model) to Z 0.0041 , are supposed to occur, would lead to simi]ar results. Tt goes without saying that theso experiments are of mere exploratory nature as there is no information on inhomogeneities in the met;aLIicity of the cluster stars. —4 —2 0 2 4 ~ I ~ . ~ . .

CHIOSI As a result of this analysis, if in NGC 1831 ~tar formation has continued or several bursts have occured during a time scale of about 6x10 yr the age of the cluster should be indicated by its oldest component, i.e. 1.4 xlO yr. Previous episodes of star formation. if they exist, cannot be identified with the present observational data. The duration of the star forming activity we have found with our simulations doeS constitute an upper limit . It could in fact. be shorter if the other causes of the discrepacy between main sequence and red giant stars are alleviated. Whether the agreement we have found by allowing for a prolonged activity of star formation is a mere coincidence and other explanations ought to be put forward we cannot say and, sharing Eggens and Ibens (1988, 1989) concern, leave the subject t.o future studies. Nevertheless, if prolonged star formation activity is real and its time scale varies from one aggregate to another, as perhaps indicated by the results of Eggen and Iben (1989) for M67, dating clusters by means of the usual method of isochrones drawn through the data will be hard, unless realistic simulations of the cluster C—M diagram and luminosity function are used. Concluding this section, we would like to call the attention on a point that might deserve future analysis. The observational hint toward star ftrmation in bursts (eventually simulating a prolonged activity) within a single cluster (or aggregate) could simply reflect the possibilty that a cluster is the result of merging of smaller units. Such an idea has recently been put forward by Bathia and MacGillivray (1988). Bathia and Hatzidimitriou (1988) and Bathia et al. (1989). These authors have pointed out that taking into account the number of pairs expected from random line-up, true binary clusters can exist in LMC and that m~tual merger is pogs.ible. The time scale of merging is estimated to be of the order of a few 10 yr to at most 10 yr on the basis of N—body calculations as for the instance of NGC 2214 studied by Bathia and MacGiliivray (1988) for which the binary hypothesis has been advanced. Although little is known about the process of cluster formation, theoretical studies suggest that they could form in giant molecular clouds as part of complexes (Elmegrgen and Elmegreen 1983) with similar ages, initial mass function and total mass of about lxlO M , which seems to be the most common value for LMC clusters as indicated by the estimates by Aigngi and Chiosi (1989) derived from the integrated cluster luminosities. This scenario for the cluster formation is perhaps also corroborated by the observational studies of Baird et al. (1974) and Elson et al. (1987, 1989) on severa] clusters that are suspected to belong to an unique complex. Although clusters in a pair are most likely coevaL it seems to us that an age difference of a few 10 yr cannot be excluded on the basis of the current understanding of this phenomenon. 6. Integrated UBVRI Colours and Magnitudes If the integrated colours of a star cluster mainly depend on the chemical composition and age of its stellar population. then theoretical calibrations of colours as a function ot the age for different compositions are very useful to obtain quantitative determinations of age and abundances of individual clusters, and thus to trace the chemical history of n~earby galaxies. Over the past few years, several calibrating relationships have been derived for both Pop I and Pop II compositions. Among others, we recall Searle et al (1973). Barbaro and Bertelli (1977), Barbaro (1981, 1982), Rabin (1982), Bruzual (1983), and Arimoto and Yoshii (1986). Even if the main properties of real clusters have already been accounted for by those calibrations, still their use is hampered by many uncertainties. First of all, they are often limited to narrow ranges of age and composition, which may generate systematic errors when different relationships are used to date clusters all over the range of possible ages. Secondly, not always all evolutionary phases implied by the types of star expected to occur in a cluster of given age are taken into account in the derivation of the integrated fluxes. In most cases. only the core H and He-burning phases are considered. Thirdly, evolutionary sequences calculated by different authors are amalgamated to derive the evolutionary scenario to start with. This aiso may be a source of systematic errors. Lastly, they rest on rather old evolutionary calculations, while, on the contrary, much progress has been made in this context over the recent years. In addition to this, there are properties of the star clusters that have not yet been fully understood. In particular. the clusters of LMC and SMC show two distinct groupings in the plane of integrated (B-~V) colours and V magnitudes (van den Bergh 1981). In fact there areclusters either bluer than about 0.4 or redder than about 0.6 and very few in between, independently of the total V magnitude. This is also visible in the correlation between the (B-V) colour and the cluster type SWB according to the classification proposed by Searle et al (1980), where it appears that all SWB I, IT and III are blue, all V, VI and VII are red, and that the blue to red transition occurs within the cluster type IV. Furthermore, the Searle et al. (1980) classification has not yet been translated into a well defined age and/or composition ranking, due to the lack of sufficient theoretical modeling of integrated STAR CLUSTERS IN THE LMC 137 properties as a function of these two parameters. In the following we will summarize the study by Chiosi et al. (1988), in which the above topics have been analysed in a coherent fashion. 6.1 The Colour—Age Relationships The colour-- age relationships at varying chemical composition and efficiency of mass loss in the RGB and AGB phases have been calculated by Chiosi et al. (1988) to whom we refer for the discussion below. Remarkable features of the (B--V) versus age relations are: i) In general the (B-V) colour gets redder at increasing age. However, under suitable combinations of the mass loss rate and chemical composition (metallicity), the colour tends to become blue again as the cluster gets older than a few billion years. This is caused by the presence in the cluster of very blue He—burning stars (mostly in HB). As expected. this effect occurs at younger ages as the mass loss rate increases. ii) Looking at the separate contribution to (B—V) colour from stars on the main sequence, in RGB and/or core He—burning, and later stages. we notice that in clusters of high metallicity the dominant trend is dictated by the main sequence stars with major deviations (in the sense that the colour gets much redder) at the onset of RGB and core He—burning in a red HB. In clusters of low meta] content the main sequence trend, which remains also after the inclusion of core He-burning stars with mass greater than MUF. ~ first destroyed by the appearance of early and late AGB stars in this mass range. and then even reversed by the effect of very blue HB stars for initial masses smaller than M HeF iii) The relative contribution of AGI3 stars mainly depends on the metallicity via the effect of mass loss. The rate of mass loss has been taken either from Reimers (1975) or Fusi-Pecci and Renzini (1976). In clusters of high metal content and almost independently of the particular algorithm adopted for the mass loss rate, AGB stars are expected to contribute slightly to the integrated (B—V) colour, whereas a much greater effect is expected in clusters of low metal content. iv) No sudden reddening in the (B—V) colour is found at the particular ages at which the RGB and AGB phases develop for the firs~? time in a cluster (see Renzini and Buzzoni 1986 for a detailed discussion of this point). The reddening in the colour prior to the onset of the AGR phase is caused by those ~tars more massive than M that spent an appreciable fraction of their lifetime. a few 10’ years, along the Hayash~1ine in stages following central He— exhaustion and prior to core C-ignition in non degenerate conditions. v) There is an age range (approximately from 3x108 to 1x109 years) in which clusters of very different metallicity possess the same (B-V) colour. 6.2 Determining the Age of Clusters from their Integrated Photometry In principle, despite the uncertainty generated by the stochastic nature of the IMF (see the discussion by Chiosi et al. 1988 on the subject), the colour--age relationships discussed in the previous section could be used to date clusters of various chemical composition when only the integrated colours are known. To this aim the colour--age relationships must be tested against clusters for which both colours and independent estimates of the age are available. While the integrated co1ours are obtained by direct observational measurements, ages can be derived from one of the following methods: I) Main Sequence turn-off and termination magnitudes. ii) The red giant star luminosity. and iii) The maximum AGB luminosity. Since all the details relative to the methods in question are given in Chiosi et al. (1988), they will not be repeated here. Using one of the above methods, ages have been derived for a sample of selected clusters (Chiosi et al. 1988). Although the chemical abundances used to derive the theoretical calibrations may not be fully suited to the clusters in question, the agreement between theory and observations is fairly good, thus confirming the validity of our calibrations. Better comparison wiJJ be possible only when accurate and homogeneous determinations of chemical abundances for individual clusters will be obtained, and the corresponding calibrating relationships calculated. however, only a small number of clusters out of the sample for which integrated colours have been measured, possess all the information required to date them on the basis of colour magnitude diagrams (turn off and main sequence termination ium~nos~ties, red giant clump luminosity, brightest AGB stars luminosities). On the other hand, it may be worth of interest to rank clusters as a function of the age even in those (more numerous) cases, in which only 138 . C.CHIOSI integrated colours and magnitudes are available. To this aim we follow the method proposed by E~son and FaLl (1985), which from the location of any cluster in the (U--B) versus (B-V) p’ane enables us to assign the so—called parameter S, analogous to the SWB types, to all of them (see Elson and FaLl 1985, for more details) . With the aid of those clusters for which both age and S are known, we get the following relation Log t = 0.062 S + 6.99, (6) where t is the age in years, and in turn a relation between SWB and S or t. Relations (6) is somewhat different from the correspondent one by E]son and Fail (1985). This arises only from the different ages assigned to the calibrating clusters in virtue of the novel isochrones from models with convective overshoot. 6.3 The Colour Gap: Phase Transition or Cluster Formation History ? It has been known for long time that the integrated magnitude V versus (B-V) diagram of LMC (as well as SMC) clusters shows a gap in the colour range 0.4 < (B-V) < 0.6, in the sense that very few clusters of any total luminosity fall in this region (van den Bergh 1981). A similar gap seems to occur also in the plane (B--V) versus c1Ust.(~r type (SWB) of Searle et al. (1980), the transition being centered at type IV. Several explanations have been advanced: age gap and/or effects of cluster disruption (van den Bergh 1981); RGB and/or AGB phase transitions, in that. the sudden appearance of those phases would drastically redden the co’our on a very short time SCale (G~iscoigne 1980: Renzini l98~; Renzini and Buzzoni 1983); transition of the core Heburning phase from loop to clump. All these possibilities have been recently discussed by Renzirii and Buzzoni (1986) . However, none of these has been yet quantitatively tested on the basis of detai led colour evolution models. A]t.houcth the preference goes to the RGB arid/or AGB hypotheses, the calibrating relationships we have presented in so far show little evidence of this. In fact. although these phase transit~ons are )ncluded in the (lerivat:ion of the integrated fluxes, there is rio visible effect in the integrated (B-V) and (U—B) coioUrs. We are therefore inciined to conclude that the colour gap originates from other cadses, among which we recall the effect of a period of star formation inactiv~t.v iii I.MC, the result of the rapid disruption and/or fading of the young blue clusters as suggested by van den Bergh (1981). or the superposition of these two. 6.4 The Age Distribution of LMC Clusters In order to test the hypothesis of periods of inactivity in the cluster formation history, we derive the age distribution function and check whether the observational data are consistent with tI1(~ idea that the cluster formation proceeded in bursts of activity. To this aim. we foUow the study of Elson and Fall (1985), who derived the age distribution (dN’dt) for a mass Limited sample of IMC clusters sorted out from the van den Bergh (1981) list. The cluster mass is limited by means of theoretical fading lines in the B versus S plane. The fading Line .i~s locus along which a cluster of given total number of stars hence mass would evolve at increasing age. The number of clusters falling in each S or age bin is then corrected for piiot~meti’~c completeness. Adapting Elson’s and Fall (1985) precedure to the ages we are usinc. we get the following relation AN/At = 2.39 ~ L’.N’ I ( lOO062 S) ~ (7) The resulting age distribution (dN/dt) is shown in Fig.8 and compared to that by Elson and Fall (1985). The different slope of the two age distributions arises from the different S(t) relation. There are several glitches in the present age distribution which do not occur in that one by Elson and Fall (1985). In principle they could be attributed to discontinuities in the history of cluster formation. However. on one hand no great statistical significance can be given to those glitches owing to the large error bars (the square root of N), on the other hand it goes without saying that the age distribution is somewhat dependent on the adopted age binning. On the basis of the above considerations and in agreement to what already pointed out by Elson and Fall (1985). it seems reasonable to conclude that there is no convincing evidence for strong discontinuities in the rate of formation of LMC clusters, even though they cannot be definitely ruled out.

The vertical bars give an idea of the uncertainty in counting the number of clusters per age bin. The heavy (lashed Line ShOWS the data for galactic open clusters determined by Wielen (1971). All (dN/dt)’s are .in arbitrary units and normalized at the blue side Fig.9 The colour distribution. The bottom panel shows the observational data before and after correction for photometric incompleteness. The top panel displays the theoretical distribution expected from eq. (8) when the observational (dN/dt), the colour-age relations with the FusiPecci and Renzini (1976) mass loss rate as indicated by ~F ‘ and a linera dependence for the law of metal enrichment are adopted (see the text for more ~etails) 6.5 The Colour Distribution of LMC Clusters As already recafled, the number frequency distribution of (B—V) colours of LMC clusters is bimodal with two peaks centered at about 0.1 and 0.6 and a gap ranging from 0.2 to 0.5. The bottom panel (a) of Fig.9 shows the frequency histogram (number N of clusters per colour bin normalized to the total number NT) obtained sampling the data of van den Bergh (1981) and Mateo and Hodge (1987) for 164 clusters in total. Before comparing the observational distributions of colours with the theoretical ones we agre going to derive, the former must be corrected for photometrical incompleteness similarly to what has been done for the age distribution function. Since per each age range we know the number of clusters added to the observational one to account for incompletenesss. the same number has been added to the number of clusters in each colour range. The conversion from age to colour is possible with the aid of the age versus S relation and the diagram (U—B) versus (B-V), which correlates S to colours. After correction, the total number of clusters increases to 307 and the colour distribution (bottom panel of Fig.9) is somewhat different from the previous one. The theoretical colour distribution distribution function f[(B—V)oJ is f[(B—V)o} = (dN/dt) I (d(B—V)/dt) (8) where (dN/dt) is the observational age distribution function and d(B-V) /dt is the colour speed. This latter can be easily derived from any colour-age relationship.°To refine our colour speed, we also consider the possibility that some degree of metal enrichment over the galaxian lifetime is required to fully match the data. Such an hypothesis is certainly not ad hoc, as many arguments exist in literature supporting this fact (see Chiosi and Matteucci 1983; Cohen 1982; Hartwick and Cowley 1981; Searle and Smith 1981). To test this point in a simple manner, Elson • FaS 7 10 Log t (B-V) 140 C. CHIOSI we derived integrated colours (B—V) and (U—B)0 supposing that the c1uster stellar population has increased its metal content with time. A linear relation has been assumed, assuming Z to be zero 15x10 years ago and equal to 0.02 at the present epoch. This would suitable modify the (B-V)o versus age relation. This is shown in Fig.lO together with the observational data. These are the cluster of van den Bergh (1981) and Mateo and Hodge (1987). Superposition of the theoretical calibration to the observational data has been made assuming a mean EBV = 0.10. In the same figure we also show the relations S(t), S(SBW) and SWB(t). Although various causes, such as dispersion in the metal content and reddening, stochastic effects in the colours caused by the finite number of stars in a cluster, uncertainties in the age assignment to individual clusters, together with uncertainties in the theoretical calibrations may concur to scatter the data in the diagram of Fig.lO, still the agreement between theory and observations is now remarkably good. The accompanying colour distribution functions are given in the top panel of Fig.9, together with the the observational ones (panel a) for comparison. This have been claculated assuming the mass loss rate by Fusi—Pecci and Renzini (1976) with their parameter ~FR The effect of varying the algorithm for the mass loss rate is marginal. The careful analysis of the dependence of the colour distribution on the various factors contributing to it clarifies that it is primariJy reflective of the age distribution, which determines the ratio of the blue to red clusters, whereas the colour speed fixes the location and.width of the gap. In, particular we point out that the colour gap cannot be simply attributed to the increase in the mean metallicity of the gas with galaxian age (Frenk and Fall 1982). In fact, even including the increase in metallicity, the right colour distribution is obtained only with the observational age distribution. 6.6 Determining the Mass of Clusters from their Integrated Photometry In principle it is possible to get information on the mass of a cluster out of its integrated magnitudes and colours. With the aid of eq.(l) and eq. (2) together with a suitable expression for the mass of stars in the cluster as function of the age. The procedure works as follows. The normalization constant A is given by log A = 0.4 (M,~At ~M~Ao + DM + A~A) (9) 50L (B V) ~: :~ ~ ~ , I ~ 1-I j11! IV ~ V ~ VI ~ Vii SWB 0 10 20 30 40 50 ~ I ~ I I I S I 0 ~ ~ ; ~ ~ 9 1~ 0 ~ 5:0 ~ ~ ~ oo ~ i~0 200 Ag~ (10 y~) Log t Fig.lO The (B-V) versus age relation, separated in its three main components, for a population of clusters whose mean metallicity is supposed to increase with the galaxy age. The part~cuiar case shown here refers to the mass loss rate of Fusi-Pecci and Renztni with ~R = 4.5x1() . The mean colour excess EBV = 0.07 has been assumed to trnsfer theoretical colours into the observational ones. The relations between the parametrer S and age and the Searle et al (1980) type (SWB) and age are shown on separate scales. Ages are in years Fig.ll Total masses of clusters in LMC from the van den Bergh (1981) sample calculated from their integrated V magnitudes a~ a function of the age obtained from8their integrated (B-V) clours. Masses are in units of 10 M0, whereas ages are in units of 10 yr STAR CLUSTERS IN THE LMC 141 where MA,~t and MA o are the theoretical and observed integrated magnitudes in a given passband (V for instance~, DM is the distance modulus and A~ is the reddening in that passband. Furtherernore, the total mass of stars in the cluster can be expressed as /Mu(t) (Mu Mt t = A,,! M ~D(M) dM + A) M~(M) D(M) dM (10) C) M1 MJt) where Mu(t) is the maximum mass of living stars in the cluster at that particular age, whereas M is the mass of remnants. M~ and ML have been already defined in section 2. Having an ehimate of the age and metaUicity, we may infer MAAt from theory, fix the normalization constant A. and finally determine the mass of the cluster. It goes without saying that this will depend on the slope of the initial mass function and the assumed lower limit ML for main sequence stars. The results obtained by Alongi and Chiosi (1989) assuming x = 1.35 ML = 0.05 and M13 :~ 100 M0 are shown in Fig.l1 for the clusters with known A~ and Mv0. 7. Star Formation in the Fields of LMC A recent study of stellar fields in LMC by Mateo et al. (1989) has shown that the distribution of stars in the C—M diagrams V versus (B--V) is compatible with a law of star formation schematically approximated by a long period of lower efficiency followed by a global enhancement that began about 3 to 4 Gyr ago. The ratio of the past to recent level of star formation, called the enhancement factor a, that yield a good agreement between theoretical simulations and observational C-M diagrams, is about 5. Other time dependences for the law of star formation would not reproduce the relative percentages of stars in different areas of the C-M diagram. The details of this study can be found in Mateo et al. (1989).

MYERS Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics 60 Garden Street, Cambridge MA 02138 USA ABSTRACT Recent observations with imaging arrays indicate that many young massive stars are accompanied by hundreds of previously unknown low-mass stars. The problem of how stars form in clusters has therefore taken on increased importance. Dense cores in embedded clusters tend to have greater size, density, and velocity dispersion than do more isolated cores. These differences can be attributed to the deeper gravitational well and to the greater concentration of mass in molecular clouds with embedded clusters than in molecular clouds without clusters. These core properties imply that cores in embedded clusters have a substantially greater rate of mass accretion than do isolated cores. This difference in dense core accretion rates should grow more pronounced as a cluster accumulates more matter and forms more stars. Thus, cores in and near a young cluster may resemble isolated, low-mass cores and produce low-mass stars, while cores in a more developed cluster may tend to have more mass, and to produce more massive stars. INTRODUCTION It has long been known that young OB stars are generally found in clusters and associations (Blaauw 1964), and that the best-studied of these stellar groups, such as the Trapezium cluster in Orion, are composed primarily of lower-mass stars (Herbig and Terndrup 1986). It has been common practice to estimate star formation efficiency in molecular clouds by attributing to distant OB stars a complement of (undetected) low-mass stars, distributed in mass according to the initial mass function for field stars (e.g., Gusten and Mezger 1982). However, these facts do not conclusively determine whether most lowmass stars are formed in clusters, or in isolation. A proper statistical study of this question has not been possible, because sensitivity limitations have prevented accurate estimates of the low-mass population for all but a few clusters. In some of the nearest star-forming complexes, including TaurusAuriga, Perseus, and Lupus, most low-mass stars form singly or in small groups (e.g., Cohen and Kuhi 1979; Herbig and Bell 1988; Krautter 1990). In other nearby regions, including Ophiuchus, Orion A, and Orion B, at least about half of the known low-mass stars are in dense clusters (Wilking, Lada, and Young 74 P.C. MYERS 1989; Herbig and Terndrup 1986; McCaughrean 1989; Strom, Margulis, and Strom 1989; Lada 1990.) In the last few years, infrared imaging observations with focal plane arrays have revealed hundreds of low-mass stars associated with luminous OB stars in GL 437, W3(OH), Orion A, Orion B, M17, S106,and S269 (McCaughrean 1989; Gatley, DePoy, and Fowler 1988; Hoddap, Rayner, and Chen 1990). These observations lend new weight to the idea that many, if not most, low-mass stars form in clusters rather than in isolation. Therefore the problem of low-mass star formation in the cluster environment has taken on increased importance. There are evidently two distinctly different environments in which low-mass stars are formed—the relatively isolated dense core, found in a dark cloud with a few magnitudes of visual extinction, or less, and the dense core in a cluster, or protocluster, with tens or hundreds of magnitudes of extinction. In this article we compare properties of these cores, and discuss how their differing properties may be related to the stars which they form. PROPERTIES OF ISOLATED AND CLUSTER CORES Table 1 lists characteristic sizes, number densities, temperatures, and line widths of dense cores associated with low-mass and massive star-forming regions, based primarily on filled-aperture observations of the (J, K) = (1,1) rotation-inversion transition of NH3 at 1.3 cm wavelength (Myers 1990). Here we use “isolated” core to refer to a “low-mass” core and “cluster” core to refer to a “massive” core. TABLE I Observed Properties of Dense Cores Core Type Map FWHM Number Density Temperature Line FWHM (pc) (iO~cm~) (K) (kms’ ) isolated 0.05 - 0.2 1 - 10 8 - 12 0.2 - 0.4 cluster 0.3 - 0.6 1 - 10 15 - 50 1 - 2 The number density given in Table 1 is essentially a mean value over the core map size, set mostly by the optical depth and radiative decay rate of the transition. It should not be interpreted as excluding higher values at smaller size scales, which are often indicated by observations with lines sensitive to higher densities, especially in cluster cores. The differences indicated in Table 1 between isolated and cluster cores can also be seen within a single complex. In the Ophiuchus dark cloud complex, the DCO~ maps of Loren, Wootten, and Wilking (1990) indicate a relatively modest core in L1709, the filament of extinction extending east from the much more massive and opaque core L1688, associated with the HD147889 cluster (Wilking, Lada, and Young 1989). In L1688, the DCO~ emission is much more intense and extended, than in L1709, with substantially broader lines. A similar relationship exists in Orion A between NH3 line maps of OMC-1, associated with the Kleinmann-Low cluster, and OMC-2 some 2 pc away (Batria et al 1983). ROLE OF DENSE CORES 75 The prevalence of larger, more massive, more turbulent cores with density ~ i04 cm3 in regions with embedded clusters might be expected, since these same regions with embedded clusters are also larger, more massive, and more turbulent than their neighboring regions when mapped with lines such as the 1-0 transition of ‘3C0, which traces density i03 cm3. In other words, the biggest concentrations of mass on the pc scale in a complex tend to also contain the biggest concentrations of mass on the 0.1 Pc scale in the complex. Thus, a cluster core tends to sit in a more massive concentration of gas, with a deeper gravitational well, and with higher internal velocities, than does a more isolated core. CORE-STAR GENETICS The foregoing discussion of core properties allows us to consider two aspects of star formation in clusters: (1) how clusters produce a few massive stars, and (2) how clusters produce a much larger number of low-mass stars. if the core properties presented in Table 1 are representative, they imply that cluster cores have a substantially higher mass accretion rate than do isolated cores. We estimate the ratio of mass accretion rates th pr2v, where p is the mass density of accreting gas, r is the radius of the surface through which accretion occurs, and v is the accretion speed. We adopt mid-range values of 0.4 and 0.1 Pc for cluster and isolated core sizes, and 1.5 and 0.3 kms’ for cluster and isolated core line widths. If gas moves inward through a core map boundary at a speed comparable to its observed line width, cluster cores accrete matter at a rate some 80 times greater than do isolated cores. There is no evidence that star-forming infall motions occur at the size and density scales discussed here, and the smaller sizes arid higher density ranges are more relevant. But if core density structure has enough similarity from large to small scales, then at the size scale appropriate for star-forming infall motions, a cluster core accretes matter through a surface of constant density at a substantially greater rate than does a more isolated core. One reaches a similar conclusion if one neglects the nonthermal motions in the line width, and considers only motions consistent with the core temperature. If cluster cores have greater accretion rates than do isolated cores, then in a pure infall model a cluster core will produce a more massive star than will an isolated core, provided the periods of infall do not differ too greatly between the cluster and isolated cores. In a more realistic model with both infall and outflow, the net accretion rate for cluster cores will exceed that for isolated cores if the outflow rates differ less than do the infall rates. These uncertainties preclude a quantitative estimate, but a greater accretion rate is probably necessary, if not sufficient, for producing more massive stars. The foregoing picture can perhaps account for the production of relatively massive stars by cluster cores, but most cluster stars are low-mass stars similar to those formed by isolated cores. To reconcile these facts, it appears necessary to suggest that the mass in the parsec-scale-regions we identify as well-developed clusters has been increasing over time, so that the gravitational well in which cluster cores sit is much deeper than it was 106 yr ago, when the T Tauri stars now seen in the cluster were formed. if so, the cores which formed these T Tauri stars could have resembled isolated cores in their size and internal motions. 76 P.C. MYERS In order for these low-mass young-cluster cores to also resemble isolated cores in their space density, it appears necessary that they were originally dispersed over a region larger than the present-day cluster. If so, these cores would take part in the inward motion of matter as the protocluster accumulated its mass. Furthermore, once such a core formed a sufficiently dense protostellar condensation, the protostar would begin to move more ballistically in response to the gravitational pull of the cluster center of gravity, since the pressure forces tending to retard the motion of the cores would be negligible for the protostars, being much denser than their parent cores. This process might lead to an inward motion toward the cluster center of T Tauri stars significantly faster than the motion of their parent cores. This speculative picture has several aspects which can be tested. In its early stages, a developing cluster should have a concentration of gas and stars greater than in neighboring parts of the complex, but still modest in comparison with more advanced clusters. The stars in this very young cluster would be all, or nearly all low-mass stars, and the dense cores would resemble isolated cores. We can identify several regions having these properties: (1) the region of some 15 T Tauri stars near Lynds 1495 in Taurus, called “Group I” by Jones and Herbig (1979); (2) a similar region in Barnard 18 in Taurus, containing the “ilK Tau group” (Cohen and Kuhi 1979; Jones and Herbig 1979); (3) the concentration of some 8 stars in Lynds 1689N and 6 stars in Lynds 1689S in Ophiuchus (Loren, Wootten, and Wilking 1990). Furthermore, the space density of cores in and near such young clusters should be greater than in more isolated parts of the same complex. Systematic comparisons of core space density require relatively complete surveys for cores in lines which trace high gas density. Such surveys are not generally available. But the distribution of visually opaque dust around the three groups mentioned above indicates a relatively high incidence of dense gas, as expected. To summarize, this loose description of cluster development is similar to that advanced by Herbig (1962), but with additional aspects (1) continual accretion of cluster gas over more than 106 yr; (2) development of dense core size and velocity dispersion, increasing with the overall mass of the cluster region; (3) formation of single low-mass stars first, from cores resembling isolated low-mass cores, with spatial separation greater than the size of the present-day cluster; (4) possible inward motion of the T Tauri stars as they move ballistically out of their parent cores; and (5) formation of massive stars last, as their parent cores develop enough size and internal motions at high density to allow a relatively high mass infall rate.

        "abstract": "Interacting galaxies like the famous Antennae (NGC 4038/4039) or Stephan's Quintet (HCG 92) show considerable star forming activity in their tidal arms. High resolution images (e.g. from HST-observations) indicate that these regions consist of up to hundreds of massive stellar clusters or tidal dwarf galaxies (TDG). In this paper we want to investigate the future fate of these clusters of massive star clusters (in this work called super-clusters).

Interacting galaxies like the famous Antennae (NGC 4038/4039) orStephan’s Quintet (HCG 92) show considerable star forming activity in their tidalarms. High resolution images (e.g. from HST-observations) indicate that these re-gions consist of up to hundreds of massive stellar clusters or tidal dwarf galaxies(TDG). In this paper we want to investigate the future fate of these clusters ofmassive star clusters (in this work called super-clusters). We simulate compact super-clusters in the tidal field of a host-galaxy and investigate the influence of orbital andinternal parameters on the rate and timescale of the merging process. We show thatit is possible that such configurations merge and build a dwarf galaxy, which could bean important mechanism of how long-lived dwarf satellite galaxies form. A detailedstudy of the merger object will appear in a follow-up paper.Keywords: methods: numerical – galaxies: interaction – galaxies: dwarf galaxies –galaxies: star clusters – star clusters: merging1. IntroductionHigh resolution images from HST-observations of the Antennae galaxies(Whitmore et al. 1999, Zhang & Fall 1999) show that the star formingregions there consist of up to hundreds of young (ages 3–7 Myr), com-pact massive star clusters with dimensions of a few pc. The young starclusters in the Antennae have effective radii Reff = 4 pc and massesof the order 104 – 106 M⊙. These clusters are not evenly distributedbut themselves clustered in super-clusters spanning regions of severalhundred pc in projected diameter and have concentrated cores, i.e. thecluster-density in the centre of the super-cluster is higher than in theouter parts. The richness of the super-clusters spans from groups ofonly a few to super-clusters containing hundreds of new star clusters.In other systems like Arp 245, Duc et al. (2000) find a bound stellarc© 2011 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.mfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.12 Fellhauer et al.and gaseous object at the tip of the tidal tail. (Their numerical modelsshow that the system is seen at approximately 100 Myr after the closestapproach of the interacting pair.) This so-called tidal dwarf galaxy(TDG) contains old and new stellar material, a lot of gas and alsoundissolved massive stellar clusters. Systems like the merger remnantNGC 7252 (Miller et al. 1997) show a distribution of young massive starclusters which has the same age as the interaction (≈ 700 Myr). Allthese observations show that galaxy interactions lead to the formationof new massive and compact star clusters.Finally, galaxies like our Milky Way host several dwarf galaxies(e.g. dSph or dE) (Mateo 1999) with high specific globular clusterfrequencies (Grebel 2000) and globular clusters in their tidal streams.With this project we investigate the future fate of clusters of youngmassive star clusters. According to Kroupa (1998) it is possible thatsuch configurations merge and build a dwarf galaxy. Therefore we sim-ulate compact super-clusters in the tidal field of a host-galaxy andinvestigate the influence of orbital and internal parameters on the rateand timescale of the merging process (i.e. how fast the single clustersmerge and how many star clusters are able to survive this process). Inaddition the properties of the resulting merger object and its dynamicalevolution are studied. A detailed description of the properties of themerger objects will be given in a follow up paper.2. The SimulationsThe simulations are performed with the particle-mesh code Superbox(Fellhauer et al. 2000). In Superbox densities are derived on Cartesiangrids using the nearest-grid-point scheme. From these density arrays thepotential is calculated via a fast Fourier-transformation. The particlesare then integrated forward in time using a fixed time-step Leap-Frogalgorithm. Superbox has a hierarchical grid architecture which in-cludes for each object two levels of high-resolution sub-grids. Thesesub-grids stay focused on the objects and travel with them through thesimulation space, providing high resolution at the places of interest (inthis case the super-cluster and the single clusters within).The massive star clusters are simulated as Plummer-spheres con-taining 100,000 particles each, having a Plummer-radius of Rpl = 6 pcand a cutoff radius Rcut = 30 pc. Each cluster has a total mass ofMcl = 106 M⊙ and a crossing time of 1.4 Myr.The super-cluster is also modelled as a Plummer distribution madeup of N0 star clusters described above, has a Plummer-radius Rscpl andcutoff radius Rsccut = 6Rscpl. The Plummer-radius of the super-cluster hasmfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.2Merging Star Clusters 3values of 50, 75, 150 and 300 pc. In this project the number of clustersis kept constant at N0 = 20, which is a typical number of star clustersfound in these super-clusters. N0 was chosen small enough to get resultswith a considerable amount of CPU-time. Higher values of N0 will bedealt with using the newly available parallel version of Superbox inthe near future. In our calculations the super-clusters have an initialvelocity-distribution according to the Plummer-distribution we gavethem (i.e. they are initially in virial equilibrium).The super-cluster orbits through the external potential of a parentgalaxy, which is given byΦ(r) =12v2circ · ln(R2gal + r2)(1)with Rgal = 4 kpc and vcirc = 220 km/s. We refer the reader to Kroupa(1998), who describes the isolated case. The centre of the super-clustermoves on a circular orbit at distance D around the centre of the galaxy.The distance D from the galactic centre is varied to be 5, 10, 20, 30,50 and 100 kpc.The tidal radius Rt of the super-cluster depends mainly on D, buthas also a low dependency on Rscpl. Rt lies at the local maxima of Φeff .It can be derived numerically by setting ∂Φeff/∂r = 0 where Φeff isΦeff(r) =12v2circ · ln(R2gal + r2)− GMRscpl·1 +(r −DRscpl)2−1/2(2)− 12(vcirc.orb.D· r)2.The grids in this project are chosen to have 643 mesh-points withthe following sizes:− The innermost grids cover single star clusters and have sizes (2 ·Rcore) of 60 pc. This gives a resolution of 1 pc per cell.− The medium grids have sizes (2 ·Rout) approximately equal to thecut-off radius of the super-cluster (Rsccut) to ensure that every starcluster is in the range of the medium grid of every other cluster.This means the medium grids have the sizes shown in Table I− The outermost grid (size: 2 ·Rsystem) covers the orbit of the super-cluster around the galactic centre. This means 2 ·Rsystem is chosento be 10 kpc larger than 2 · D, where D is the distance of thesuper-cluster from the galactic centre.mfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.34 Fellhauer et al.Table I.

Results discussed later for one pair of the parameterset are computed mean values out of the different simulations. Ourstudy covers more than the observed ranges of parameters to show theinfluences of the different parameters more clearly.This is a first theoretical and numerical approach to investigate thefate of the super-clusters. Although, in nature, it is unlikely that twostar clusters form overlapping but with uncorrelated velocities, we donot reject random number placements which put two clusters in amfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.4Merging Star Clusters 5distance where they already overlap. Our simulations do not includegas dynamics, therefore they are valid after the expulsion of gas fromthe star clusters. By that time, clusters in the centre could alreadyoverlap each other.3. ResultsThe number of star clusters in the super-cluster decreases due to twoconcurrent processes. The first and also the most important one is themerging process. The second one is the escape of star clusters from thesuper-cluster. Escape plays an important role only on long timescalesor if the super-cluster is larger than its tidal radius (i.e. β > 1).N(t) = N0 − nm(t)− nesc(t) (4)where nm is the number of merged clusters and nesc the number ofescaped clusters.3.1. Merging TimescalesIn our simulations the timescale of the merger process is very short.Most cluster merge within the first few crossing times of the super-cluster, forming a dense and spherical merger object in the centre ofthe super-cluster.To determine the timescale of this merger process we first have alook at simulations with β < 1.0. With this restriction we can neglectthe number of escaping clusters (i.e. nesc(t) ≡ 0).Then we take the following ansatz for the decrease of the numberof clusters. If a star cluster makes one crossing through the super-cluster the chance to meet and merge with another cluster is the areacovered by the cross-sections of all other clusters divided by the areaof the super-cluster. We therefore define the merger-rate R (numberof merger events per dimensionless time unit) as the ratio betweenthe cross-sections of all (N) star clusters (Ahit) travelling through thesuper-cluster and the area of the super-cluster Asc. The merger rate Rper T sccr (crossing time of the super-cluster) should therefore be givenbyR = −dNdτ= N · AhitAsc(5)withτ =tT sccr(6)mfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.56 Fellhauer et al.being a dimensionless time andAsc = π · (Rsccut,eff )2 (7)= π · (γ ·Rscpl)2is the projected area of the super-cluster with a mean radius thatincludes all clusters. This radius is smaller than Rsccut due to the factthat the super-clusters contain only a limited number of clusters. Inour simulations we find that γ is given by γ = 3.8± 0.1.For the cross-sections of all clusters we take the ansatz (see alsoFig. 1)Ahit = (N − 1) · Acl with (8)Acl = π · r2mAscAclAhitFigure 1. Schematic view of the first ansatz to determine the merging timescales.Every star cluster sees the cross-section Acl of N − 1 other clustersand rm being the maximum distance at closest approach which leadsto a merger afterwards. R is then proportional to N2 and the numberof clusters N(τ) should decrease with time proportional to 1/(1 + kτ).To determine Acl we first have to check how the average encounterbetween two star clusters (or a star cluster and the merger object) lookslike. Therefore we have to check the relative velocities and separationsat the point of closest approach, which afterwards leads to the mergingof the two star clusters. Fig. 2 shows the relative separation between aparticular star cluster and the merger object. One can clearly see thatthe two objects are separated at their first encounter, implying thedistance at closest approach is larger than the mean square radius of asingle cluster. Their relative velocity is larger than the average velocityinside the super-cluster but less than a factor of three. Because evenmfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.6Merging Star Clusters 7Figure 2.

Dashed lines show the half-mass- and the 90%-radii of the mergerobject.

For α > 0.085 we argue below thatin our parameter range we already start with a merged object in thecentre of the super-cluster, and therefore Mcl has to be replaced byνMcl where ν is the number of merged central clusters. With ν ≥ 2and increasing with increasing α, Eq. 9 holds for all values of α in ourparameter space.In this paper, we define two clusters as merged if their mutualdistance stays smaller then five Plummer-radii Rpl for the rest of thesimulation. We found that 5Rpl is a good compromise between declar-mfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.78 Fellhauer et al.ing no cluster as merged (the merger criterion being chosen too small)and merging all clusters right form the beginning (their mean distancebeing smaller than the merger criterion). Smaller merger radii haveproblems in the late stages of the simulation, where the centres ofdensity of dissolved clusters are very hard to determine and could befound off-centre of the extended merger object. If the merger radius ischosen too small, these clusters would not be counted as merged. Anenergy criterion has to be handled with care, because clusters may bebound to the merger object without merging but staying on a circularorbit and decaying on the dynamical friction timescale.The next step is to approximate the energy gain of the clusters dueto the passage. Aguilar & White (1985) showed that the total energyexchange in the tidal approximation given by Spitzer (1958),∆E =12Mcl(2GMclr2pvp)223r2c , (10)gives reasonable results if rp ≥ 5rc. In this formula rc denotes the meansquare radius of a single cluster. With a cut-off of 6Rpl we calculate themean square radius of a Plummer-sphere as approximately 1.5Rpl whichgives r2c ≈ 2.3R2pl. Fig. 2 shows that the two objects pass each other forthe first time at a distance which holds for the criterion of Aguilar &White. rp and vp are the distance and the velocity at the point of closestapproach. If we assume that vp is equal to the mean relative velocityof two clusters in the super-cluster,√2σsc, i.e. we neglect gravitationalfocusing and the acceleration of the star clusters firstly and taken intoaccount that both clusters are able to gain energy we get∆E = 24 · 2.33 · 2G2M3clR2plr4pσ2sc. (11)To obtain the critical impact parameter which leads to a merger, weset the energy exchange equal to the orbital energy of the two clustersin the super-cluster: ∆E = 14Mcl (√2σsc)2. Inserting for σsc the meanvelocity of “particles” in a Plummer-sphereσ2sc =3π32GMscRscpl(12)with Msc = N0Mcl and using the definition of α from Eq. 3, one obtainsfor rprp =(8 · 322 · 2.33(3π)2N20)1/4· √α ·Rscpl ≈ 0.65√α · Rscpl. (13)mfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.8Merging Star Clusters 9In this formula we have not taken into account that the clusters aregravitationally focused. Inserting Spitzers (1987; eq. 6-15) formula forgravitational focusing,rm = rp√1.0 +4GMclrp(√2σsc)2, (14)we obtainrm = 0.65 ·√α ·√1.0 +0.52√α· Rscpl. (15)Given the values of α of our simulations we derive the values for rmgiven in Table III. The merger rate R is thenTable III.

We note that this ansatz does not lead to agood description of our results. It leads to an α dependency of rp ∝ α2,which is steeper than we find in our simulations. Also the merger theorymfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.10Merging Star Clusters 11of Makino & Hut (1997) does not agree with our results. They find adependency on α with a power of 1.5, which does not fit our data.In our simulations we find a very weak dependency of the mergingtimescales on the parameter α. For our main parameter range (α =0.02−0.12) there is even no visible dependency. The simulations show aclear exponential decrease of the number of clusters with dimensionlesstime τ independent of the choice of α (see Fig. 3). Therefore, a mergertheory depending on the merging of single clusters must be wrong.The mean projected distance of clusters inside the innermost Plum-mer radius of the super-cluster depends only on the choice of N0 andis given bydmean(1Rscpl) = κ ·√√√√π(Rscpl)2Nproj. (21)Numerical simulation shows that κ is given by 0.53. Since half the starclusters lie within one projected Plummer radius, we get for our choiceof N0 = 20 → Nproj = 10dmean(1Rscpl) ≈ 0.30Rscpl. (22)Comparing this value with the merger radii rm for our choices of α (seeTable III) one can see that in the centre of the super-cluster the meandistance between two clusters (within the innermost Plummer-radiusRscpl) is comparable the merger radius for most α. In the centre the clus-ters are not able to separate from each other right from the beginningand the merging of them should therefore happen very quickly withinone or two crossing times of the super-cluster, especially for high α.In this case we have to deal with a big merger object covering thecentral area of the super-cluster. Merging happens preferably with thiscentral object. Therefore, our ansatz for Ahit in Eq. 8 fails. Instead weuse the following ansatz shown in Fig. 4. The merging cross-sectionAhit is now a fraction ǫ of the area of the whole super-cluster AscAhit = ǫAsc. (23)which has to be determined. Inserting in Eq. 5 (R = −dN/dτ = ǫN)and integrating leads toN(τ) = N0 · exp(−ǫτ). (24)The exponential decrease, according to Eq. 24, is plotted in Fig. 3as the solid lines. There one sees clearly that the number of clustersfirst decreases exponentially. One should also notice that the mergingtimescale is now independent of the choice of α.mfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.1112 Fellhauer et al.AhitAscmerger objectFigure 4. Schematic view of the new ansatz to determine the merging timescales.After all clusters travelling through the centre have merged with thecentral merger object, the further decrease of N with time levels off.This is due to the fact that even if β < 1.0 there is the chance thatsome clusters escape and as a second effect there are clusters on rathercircular orbits which do not travel through the central area. In low αcases (α = 0.04, 0.02) these clusters do not merge but their orbits willdecay on timescales of the dynamical friction.To prove the independency on α we consider two characteristicquantities, namely the mean merger rate within the first crossing time(R1.T sccr ) and the half-life merging time (T1/2), i.e. the dimensionlesstime until N0/2 of the clusters have merged. Fig. 5 shows the numberof clusters merging within the first crossing time, and the time it takesto merge half the clusters. All simulations with the same α, and whichhave β < 1, are binned together. As can be seen, there is no dependencyon α.The mean merger rate within the first crossing time and the meanhalf-life merging time derived from our simulations are given byR1.T sccr = 3.90 ± 0.32 [merger events/T sccr ] (25)T1/2 = 4.18 ± 0.35 [T sccr ]are plotted in Fig. 5 and are also displayed in Fig. 6. Inserting thisvalues in our ansatz (Eq. 23) for the merging times givesǫ ≈ 0.2. (26)Fig. 6 shows the mean values of R1.T sccr and T1/2 for all combinationsof (α, β). It is clearly visible that there is no dependency of the resultson β at all. It therefore seems that β influences the number of clusterswhich are able to merge rather than the timescale of the merger process.mfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.12Merging Star Clusters 13Figure 5. R1.T sccrand T1/2 as function of α for all simulations with β < 1. Solid linesshow mean values from Eq. 25 while dotted line corresponds to the α-dependenttheory from Eq. 16.We expect to obtain a change in the initial behaviour of the systemif rm falls well below the mean projected distance of the clusters. Forour choice of N0, this should happen approximately for α ≤ 0.02. Thenour first ansatz (Eq. 5) should represent the system. On the otherhand if α becomes higher than ≈ 0.2, the mean distance of all clustersis smaller than the merger radius – all N0 star clusters should thenmerge within one or two crossing times. To prove this behaviour weperformed test calculations without tidal field. The results (Fig. 7)show nicely the transition between these three regimes. The upper leftpanel is a simulation with α = 0.24 and one sees clearly that almostall clusters merge within the first two crossing times. In the lower rightpanel a simulation with α = 0.006 is displayed. The number of clustersdecreases according to our α-dependent theory.3.2. Merger-RatesThe number of clusters, nm, which end up in the merger object showsno significant dependency on α and β, as long as the super-clusterconfiguration is well inside it’s tidal radius (i.e. β < 1.0). In this casemfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.1314 Fellhauer et al.Figure 6. R1.T sccr(boxes) and T1/2 (crosses) as a function of β for the different choicesof α. Solid line is the mean value for T1/2, dashed line for R1.T sccrfrom Eq. 25.almost all clusters merge and only one or two clusters sometimes surviveby chance. As one can see in Fig. 8, nm is close to N0 = 20.This changes if β becomes larger than 1. There is a significant dropin nm which also shows a weak α-dependency.We interpret this result as follows: We start with Eq. 4 and neglectthe rare case of an escaping merged cluster here. If β is small (β < 1)tidal effects are not dominant, and the evolution of N(t) is determinedby the merger processes alone as discussed before. If β > 1 there isa trend that clusters can leave the super-cluster before participatingin the merger events. The number of escaping clusters depends onhow many clusters initially are outside the tidal radius and on theindividual velocities of such clusters.

Number of merged clusters nm vs. parameter β for different values of α.merging clusters, and second, this trend is more pronounced for smallα. This result is consistent with the picture that strong tidal fields leadto more escapers (i.e. less clusters available for merging); if, however,the individual clusters are relatively extended (larger α), the mergingcompetes with the escape; clusters on orbits of potential escapers couldbe captured in the central regions by merging with a higher probability.Binning the simulations in 5 β-bins, as shown in Fig. 9, shows thatthe dependency on β is linear. As best-fit for the data of our simulationswe calculatenm = 20− (2.5± 0.1) · β. (27)To advance that kind of reasoning to an extreme, we could compareour results with the findings of Baumgardt (1998), who models theescaping stars from star clusters. He proposes a β3/2-dependency. Ourresults are consistent with Baumgardt’s results, in particular for α → 0in which case N(τ) → N0 in Eq. 17 (where nesc was neglected), so thatmfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.16Merging Star Clusters 17Figure 9.

Straight line is the fitted linear decrease; curved line would be thetheoretical β3/2-dependency as stated in Baumgardt (1998).N(t) → N0 − nesc(t) (Eq. 4). Note, however, that our particle numberis very small compared to that work.3.3. Building Up the Merger ObjectsThe formation scenario of the merger object depends on the chosenα-value. One finds that with high values of α, one has overlappingstar clusters at the centre right from the beginning, and the simulationalready starts with a merger object in the centre of the super-cluster.With decreasing values of α, the merger-tree starts with the mergingof clusters at different positions in the super-cluster. Afterwards, thesemerger objects sink to the centre and merge together. The exact detailsof the merging depend however on the starting conditions, and therecan always be cases with high α behaving like low α and vice versa.Fig. 10 and 11 show some snapshots of the evolution of clusters withhigh and low α-values.mfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.1718 Fellhauer et al.Figure 10. Surface-density contour plots (resolution: (10 pc)2) of a simulation withα = 0.12 and D = 10 kpc. The crossing time of the super-cluster is 7.4 Myr. Highvalues of α correspond to compact super-clusters with short crossing times.Since the crossing-time of the super-cluster expressed in physicalunits depends on its size and therefore on α, the merger rates, ifexpressed in Myrs, also depend on α: Large α-values correspond tocompact clusters which merge within a few tens of a Myr, while smallα-values correspond to extended clusters in which it can take up to 1Gyr until all clusters are finally merged.After 20 Myr almost every cluster has already fallen into the mergerobject at the high α simulation (Fig. 10). At t = 100 Myr only the lastsingle cluster can be seen (as a disturbance in the contours) mergingwith the main object.In the low α simulation (Fig. 11) almost every cluster is seen as anindividual object, even after 100 Myr. After 1 Gyr the merger objectis surrounded by clusters which are still in the process of merging.These clusters may account for a high specific cluster frequency ofthe merger object. Not shown in the last snapshot are the 2 escapingclusters travelling on the same orbit around the galaxy as the mergerobject.The merger objects show an exponential density distribution withexponential scale-length rexp ≈ 10 pc and follow a de-Vaucouleur sur-face density profile with line-of-sight velocity dispersions about 20 km/s.A detailed description and analysis of our merger-objects is subject ofFellhauer (2000) and a follow-up paper. Here we merely briefly notethat our merger objects fall in the region between dwarf galaxies andglobular clusters in the central surface brightness – absolute magnitudemfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.18Merging Star Clusters 19Figure 11.

Such objects evolve intodSph-like systems in a periodic tidal field (Fig. 13 in Kroupa 1997;Fig. 2 in Kroupa 1998b). More massive and extended merger-objectscan, of course, be obtained by suitable choices of Rscpl and Msc, but wedefer a more detailed discussion of this to the future.4. ConclusionsWe have performed a set of self-consistent dynamical models of clustersof twenty gas-free star clusters, as they have been recently observedin the Antennae galaxies. For all our models, a central merger objectmfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.1920 Fellhauer et al.formed out of a large fraction of the single clusters. As long as thesuper-cluster is smaller than its tidal radius, almost all clusters merge.For our choice of parameters (5 kpc ≤ D ≤ 100 kpc and 300 pc≤ Rsccut ≤ 1.8 kpc) the merger process does not depend significantlyon the two main dimensionless parameters of the problem, the tidalfield strength relative to the super-cluster concentration (β) and therelative concentration of the super-clusters and the individual clusters(α). The cluster merging process cannot be modelled by a sequence oftwo-body merger events, but is a “collective” interaction, where the firstpassage (“encounter”) of a cluster through the dense central region ofthe super-cluster leads to the assimilation into a growing merger object.The timescale of the merging process is the same (measured in internalcrossing times of the super-cluster T sccr ) for all models. Measuring timein years shows that high α calculations form the merger object withinvery short times (≈ 50 Myr), while for extended clusters (low α) thisprocess can take up to 1 Gyr or even longer.While for very strong tidal fields the tidal mass loss as e.g. discussedby Baumgardt (1998) dominates and merging processes are suppressed,and for the limit where the individual clusters approach point massesthe merging is suppressed as well, our parameter range, which is consis-tent with the observations, always allows for the quick merger scenarioon a few crossing time scales. Tidal mass loss is only a secondary effectfor part of our parameter space (stronger tidal field) due to a slightreduction of the number of clusters available for merging. The numberof merged clusters nm decreases linearly with β if β becomes largerthan 1.0.We do not claim that our process of forming dwarf galaxies is theonly possible way how these objects form, but at least it is one possibleway to explain the existence of low-mass dwarf galaxies in the vicinityof large “normal” galaxies like our Milky Way. In addition, some “side-effects” can be explained by our models. It takes very long until allclusters finally end up in the merger object for low values of α. Suchsystems could account for a high specific globular cluster frequencyfound in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Our models develop tidal tails whichspread along the orbit of the dwarf galaxy. Surviving escaped starclusters are also found on the orbit. This is similar to what is observedfor the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy.AcknowledgementsPart of this project (parallelisation of the code, use of high-performancecomputing power) was carried out at the Edinburgh Parallel Comput-mfellhauer.tex; 29/12/2011; 13:08; p.20Merging Star Clusters 21ing Centre (EPCC) by the TRACS-programme.

        "abstract": "As astronomical observational technologies have been developing, more and more massive young clusters (MYC) and super star clusters (SSC) in different galaxies including normal ones, starburst ones and mergers have been found, some properties of which are different from either open or globular clusters in the Galaxy, mainly their ages being significantly younger than those of globular ones in the Milky Way galaxy on one side and they being obviously more massive than open ones on the other side. Up to now, at least one SSC has been found in our own galaxy. The main observational characteristics of MYCs or SSCs are as follows: 1) They are young and massive star clusters. Usually their ages are several million years, the oldest ones of which are not over a few hundred million years, their masses are 3 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> - 10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, and the range of their effective radii is a few parsecs to 20 pc, even a bit bigger. 2) The distribution of MYCs in host galaxies is quite different from one galaxy to another. In some galaxies most of MYCs are close to the galactic centers, and in other galaxies they have been observed at places far from the centers. 3) A bright compact nucleus can be easily observed in some MYCs and there is no obvious nucleus for other MYCs. 4) The numbers of MYCs in different galaxies are of significant difference, from zero to a few dozens, even more than 100. 5) The distribution in ages is quite smooth for spiral galaxies, being no more the case of star burst galaxies, in which MYCs are apparently formed in a relative short period. The formation efficiency of MYCs is in close relationship with star formation rate (SFR) for both, normal galaxies and interacting ones, and the higher the SFR, the higher the formation efficiency of such clusters. So far as the evolutionary significance of MYCs is concerned, MYCs, at least some of them, are possible precursor objects of globular star clusters for some reasons, which can be used to explain the origin of globular clusters. Since observational data for MYCs or SSCs in galaxies are limited by now, some important problems for such clusters remain to be further studied and solved, such as what is the intrinsic relationship between the SFR and the formation efficiency of MYCs, is there some relationship between the formation and evolution of MYCs and their host galaxies, and whether can MYCs exist for long enough time to be finally evolved to form globular clusters?",

This evidence is briefly reviewed, and the detectability of such radiation from nearby galaxies is examined.",
