Earth-based spectral reflectance remote-sensing techniques have been developed to detect absorption features, characteristic of specffic rock-forming minerals, occurring in the solar reflected light from planetary surfaces (Adams, 1974, 1975; McCor4 1988). Analysis of UV, visible, and near-infrared spectral reflectance data has proven to be the most powerful technique for determining surface composition and lithology. IWo significant accomplishments of solar system spectroscopy have been the studies of the lunar mare surfaces (e.g., McCord et a!., 1976; Pieters, 1978) and asteroids (e.g., Gaffey et a!., 1977). Compositional data of the lunar surface have been obtained from reflectance spectra in the 0.30-to 2.50-sam domain (e.g., Pieters, 1978, 1986; Hawke et a!., 1979; McCord et aL, 1981; Gaddis et a!., 1985; Lucey et a!., 1986; Coombs et a!., 1987) and from multispectral imaging using vidicon techniques (McCord et a!., 1976; Johnson et al., 1977.) individual reflectance spectra are helpful in characterizing selected spots, while the determination of the horizontal extent of identffied spectral units is more easily done with the multispectral data. Regional geological investigations of the southern part of Oceanus Procellarum (Pieters et aL, 1980) and Mare Humorum (Pieterc et a!., 1975) are examples of studies using both methods. Both of these studies concentrated on regional mapping and interpretation of the mare surfaces in relation to structural features and did not focus on the analysis of highland regions and complex morphological units such as impact craters. Such investigations were subsequently addressed by means of high-resolution (2-3-km-diameter areas) visible and near-infrared reflectance spectra (0.72.5 jsm) within both mare and highland craters (McCord et a!., 1981; Pieters, 1982, 1986; Pieters eta!., 1985). Rapid progress in the development of the charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging technique (Was 1985; Chevrel and Pinet, 1988;Jaumann andNeukum, 1989; Lucey and Hawke, 1989) allows a complementary approach consisting of nearinfrared multispectral mapping of complex morphological units. In this paper we present high spatial resolution (0.5 lan! pixel) visible and near-infrared images, obtained with a CCD camera on the 2-m Pic-du-Midi telescope (Chevrel and Pinet, 1989), of Gassendi, a typical floor-fractured crater located at the edge of Mare Humorum. Cheurel and Pinet (1988) presented a set of lower resolution (3 km!pixel) images that had been taken during an earlier observational program. DATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING The multispectral imaging system comprises a CCD detector placed behind high-quality image interferenthi ifiters. This photometric detector allows one to obtain directly a numerical image of a particular target on the lunar surface. This system offers a combination of qualities: good quantum efficiency, excellent linearity over the whole spectral domain of sensitivity (from 0.40 to 1.10 ~tm), large dynamic range, low noise and dark current, and a good overall system stabffity. Images presented in this paper have been made using a GO) array with 576 x 384 pixels from Thomson-CSF (THIX 31 133). It was placed at the focus of the 2-m aperture telescope (F! D = 25) of the Pic-du-Midi Observatory in France (elevation: 2877 m). An evaluation of the performance of the CCDThomson detector (Meiier et a!., 1986) demonstrated a low read-out noise, a uniform response across the chip (leading to better photometric accuracy), and a high linearity (deviation <0.001) and storage capacity per pixeL With the whole chip illuminated when imaging the lunar surface, we did not exceed the maximum storage capacity limit for one pixel, an output signal of 60,000 electrons or 4500 ADU units (Mellier et al., 1986). The optimal signal-to-noise ratio 188 Proceedings of the 20th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference conditions are obtained by cooling the CCD to -80°C with liquid nitrogen. The high quality image interferential ifiters used are centered at 5585 A and 9700 A and have the following respective optical characteristics: bandwidth = 1 10 A, 94 A; transmission peak T (%) = 80%, 50%. Given the optical system and the pixel dimension (a square 23 j~m in size), the field of view is 54 x 36\" and corresponds to a target of 96 x64 km on the lunar surface at the subterrestrial point and to a theoretical spatial resolution of 0.2 km/pixel. The multispectral dataset for a given area on the Moon comprises a sequence of two sets of images, one in the nearinfrared (0.97 jsm) and the other in the visible (0.56 jsm) domain. Within a set, images are taken at a rate of one per minute with a time interval of five minutes between two consecutive sets. Time integration, determined by an electronic shutter, is less than one second Images are coded in 16-bit intensities and stored in HTS format on magnetic tape for subsequent processing. The actual processing consists of ( 1) the selection of images and their calibration and normalization within a given set; and (2) the superposition and division of a near-infrared (IR) image by a visible (VIS) image, resulting in an image ratio [R/ VIS. Selection of images in a set is made by dividing one image by each of the others in that set. The correlation coefficient and standard deviation (a r.m.s.) are calculated, and the pair of images that shows the best stability (a 2-3%) is selected. Calibration of an image allows the removal of instrumental effects and a correction for the slight pixel-to-pixel nonuniforniity of the chip for a given wavelength For each raw image taken with a given ifiter, there is a corresponding fiat field image, or one that exposes a uniformly lit field (t~light sky) through the telescope (with the same ifiter). A dark field image is also made, which is an exposure at the same integration time as the raw image and the fiat field image, except the shutter is not opened. After the dark field image has been subtracted from both previous images, the raw image is divided by the flat field image resulting in a photometrically calibrated image. To derive absolute reflectance values requires taking into account atmospheric corrections, instrumental sensitivity, flux calibrations, etc. However, accurate relative reflectance values can be obtained using relative reflectance produced during normalization. Consequently, calibrated images are normalized to a given area taken as a standard within the imaged region. The choice of the standard area is made on the basis of its spectral homogeneity at both wavelengths, evaluated by means of the standard deviations ci~ and aff. Normalization is accomplished by dividing the spectral images by the respective mean values of the standard area. Because the repetition of the telescopic pointing on a given feature of the lunar surface is not better than a few pixels in accuracy, a pair of near-infrared and visible images have to be geometrically superposed before derivation of the spectral ratio image. One image is shifted onto the other and the best fit is reached by calculating the maximum correlation between the two images in a square 200 pixels in size, including \"sharp\" lunar features such as central peaks in a crater. Once the images are normalized and superposed, the IR/VIS image pixelby-pixel ratio is calculated. The result is a spectral ratio image or multispectral image IR/YIS normalized to a standard area in the image. independent ratio images are made using pairs of IR and VIS calibrated images having the best stability and the smallest time interval between them. RESULTS The selected zone of investigation is the 110- km - wide Nectarian (Garr, 1984) impact crater Gassendi, situated along the northwestern border of Mare Humorum, a mare-filled multiringed basin located in the southwestern portion of the nearside of the Moon. As with many craters on the margins of large mare-filled basins, Gassendi displays a shallow, flat, fractured floor, with a central peak complex and a partial inundation by mare-like material (Fig. 1). Such craters have significance for studying the style of crater modification, the type of lunar volcanism, the sequence of inundation of the maria (possible interconnected sources responsible for partial inundation within the crater and of adjacent mare), and the thermal history of the Moon. Fig. 1. Lunar Orbiter IV-143-H2 picture of the crater Ga.ssendi, located on the northwestern edge of Mare Humorum (17°S; 40°W). Outlined area shows the imaged zone inside the crater (Figs. 2 and 3). Small square northwest of the central peak complex delimits the standard area NA (see text and Fig. 4). Arrow points to the ST unit (see text and Fig. 4) centered on the broad part of the fracture Rima Gassendi H. Chevrel and Pinet: Near-JR multispectral images for Gassendi 189 Gassendi is classified as a class ifi crater (Schultz, 1976a). These craters are characterized by a wide annular depression, or \"moat,\" between a wall scarp and a shallow plate-like floor that exhibits fractures and a central peak complex. Central peaks of craters presumably represent deep-seated material excavated during crater formation (Grieve and Head, 1983; Grieve et aL, 1981). The floor of Gassendi shows a subdued hummocky terrain and wide variations in local crater densities, reflecting the possible emplacement of extrusive units or, in the units s'there few craters exist, rapidly degraded surfaces. Fractures on the floor of Gassendi are not well ordered (Fig. 1) and sometimes intersect previously existing features such as the central peaks. These fractures are probably due to the complex modification history of the crater. Major fractures form a northeast-trending scarp that cuts off the southeast portion of the crater floor (Rima Gassendi VII), a set of northwest-trending scarps located on both sides of central peaks (Rima Gassendi IV, V, VI), and a north-trending fracture in the western portion of the crater floor (see N4S4, 1971). A partial inundation by a mare-like material occurred on the side adjacent to the mare, south of Rima Gassendi VII (Fig. 1), and several volcano-like structures have been photogeolog- ically identified along the southern part of this fracture and the eastern portion of the floor (Schultz 1976b). The shallow, fractured floor and the presence of possible extrusive centers on the floor of Gassendi and similar craters along mare borders may be of relevance for modeling the crater evolution and its subsequent topographic modification (Hall et a!., 1981). Clearly, more information is required about the composition and distribution of the different types of materials present on the floor as well as their relevance to the tectonic features. At the present time no spectra are available from selected parts of Gassendi. Medium resolution vidicon images in three bands (0.40, 0.56, and 0.95 /sm) of Mare Humorum (Pieters et al., 1975) included crater Gassendi; however, no conclusive compositional interpretation has been carried out within the crater. On September 29, 1988, an observational period on the 2m telescope of the Pic-du-Midi Observatory was devoted to the multispectral mapping of Gassendi in the visible (0.56 ~m) and the near-infrared (0.97 ~sm) wavelengths. As a result, we obtained 10 high-resolution images under stable weather and very good visibility conditions (0.3 to 0.5 arcsec). The internal consistency of the dataset, evaluated for each spectral range from the a r.m.s. standard deviation, is better than 3.5% for the visible and 2.5% for the near-infrared set of calibrated images. Figures 2 and 3, respectively, show a visible and a nearinfrared high-resolution (better than 0.5 km/pixel) image of a Fig. 2. Visible (0.56 /2m) CCD image of the northern part of Gassendi. North is at right and east is at bottom. Scale: 9 mm = 10 km. White and dark, respectively; mean a bright and a low albedo with a gray tone interval class of 15% variation on the whole intensity range. Central peaks (bright) are close to the center of the image. Western and eastern parts of the rim are at the top and bottom of the image, respectively. Southern rim of the crater Gassendi A is at the upper right. Fig. 3. Near-infrared (0.97 jsm) CCD image of the northern part of Gassendi. For orientation, scale, and gray tone coding, see Fig. 2. Field of view is approximately the same as Fig. 2. 190 Proceedings of the 20th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference common region of the crater interior, corresponding to the outlined area in Fig. 1. Central peaks appear close to the center of the images. Northwestern and northeastern parts of the crater rim are at the top and the bottom, respectively. The southern part of the rim of Gassendi A, a crater located on the northern edge of Gassendi, appears at the upper right of the image. Figure 4 shows the spectral ratio image 0.97/ 0.56 ~tm of the two previous images displayed in Figs. 2 and 3. The spectral ratio is relative to the normalization area [NA, a small square, 20 pixels in slae (Figs. 1 and 4)] in which = 2.9%, a~ = 2.1%, and the standard deviation a~ of the spectral ratio is 3.3%. The 0.97/0.56-nm multispectral measurement accuracy is estimated to be 3% on the basis of the evaluation of the mean internal consistency of the dataset. The ~r value, within NA, is on the order of the measurement accuracy and indicates that NA is spectrally very homogeneous. However, a 3% accuracy in the multispectral observations may correspond to important mineralogical composition differences (e.g., Pieters, 1978; Hawke et a!., 1979). Consequently, a 3% interval class is used in Fig. 4, and only significant compositional variations across Gassendi crater are detected Despite the high degree of correlation between the visible and the near-infrared images (r = 0.967), extreme variations in the range of ±10% relative to the standard zone NA are seen in the ratio image. A critical assessment of the reproducibility of the multispectral information is performed by comparing two ratio images derived from two independent couples of visible/near-infrared images. This test demonstrates the excellent similarity of the two ratio images. Inside Gassendi the floor globally displays a high 0.97/0.56- ~m ratio (4% to 6% above NA), except for the following specific features: (1) regions related to fractures, (2) fresh craters, and (3) the central peaks. These exceptions exhibit a spectral ratio less than or equal to unity. The most significant multispectral feature identified in the image (Fig. 4) is a triangle-shaped region, marked ST (\"spectral trough\"). Located in the northeastern portion of the crater floor, this feature exhibits a mean spectral ratio depleted by 8%, lower than that exhibited by NA, ranging down to 101 1% in its central part. The ST region is 10 km long and lies along Rima Gassendi II. This Rima is a 2-km-wide fracture that bifurcates into two branches in this area (cf. Fig. 1). The ST region extends laterally over 5 km and thus overlaps and spreads out of the fracture zone. On the eastern side of the fracture, there is a plain-forming unit with very few craters on its relatively flat surface. Scarps to the north of this unit may indicate ancient levels of lava terraces, and a probable volcanic cone lies very close to the fracture on its western side (cf. plate 37, p. 85, in Schultz, 1976b). All these volcanic features are included in the very low 0.97/0.56-Mm-ratio ST patch. North of the ST zone, in its straight continuation, there is another area spectrally depleted by 5-6% (STn in Fig. 4). Although it is not directly related to a fracture, it also corresponds to a portion of the floor where volcanic processes seem to have occurred, as evidenced by the presence of lava terraces from photogeological analysis (Schultz 1976b). South of the ST zone, also almost in its continuation, is a low spectral ratio zone, depleted by 7% to 8% and noted STs in Fig. 4, which corresponds to the northern part of the mare-like material lying in the southeastern portion of the floor of the crater (Fig. 1). Finally, an areally restricted zone, located in the eastern vicinity of the standard zone NA, has a 3% to 4% depleted ratio relative to NA, but there is no clear floor feature associated with it. One must notice, however, that a 3% depletion is at the limit of the spectral accuracy estimate and must be carefully considered. The craters Gassendi A [Cc1 material (Wilhelms and McCauley, 1971)] and Gassendi N also show a low multispectral ratio value, about 5-6% less than NA. Their spectral properties, considered as characteristic of fresh craters, may represent excavated immature material, relatively unmasked by agglutinates resulting from subsequent soil maturation Fig. 4. A 0.97/0.56-/1m spectral ratio image, obtained from images in Figs. 2 and 3 (same scale and orientation), normalized to the standard area NA (a square 20 X 20 pixels in size). Gray tone scale ranges from dark (10% below unity) to bright (10% above unity) with an interval class of 3% variation. P1 = peak 1; ST = spectral trough region; STn and STs = northern and southern extensions of the ST region; X unnamed crater (see text for further description). Note that both white and dark patches near the eastern rim at bottom are artifacts in the image. Chevrel and Pinet: Near-JR multispectral images for Gassendi 191 processes (e.g., Pieters, 1977). Central peaks have the same ratio as the normalization area except for one peak; P1 in Fig. 4, which has the same ratio as the surrounding crater-floor material A last striking observation is that outside Gassendi, in the external vicinity of the northeastern rim, there exists a broad zone (bottom right part of Fig. 4) with an average spectral ratio of around 8% above NA, locally exceeding 10%. MARE HUMORUM LNTERPRET~VflON AND CONCLUSIONS The high spatial resolution 0.97/0.56-pm multispectral image of the northern portion of Gassendi presented in Fig. 4 shows horizontal spectral variations on the floor of the crater. The sketch map (Fig. 5) shows these variations in relation to topographic, morphological, and geological features, after the ratio image (Fig. 4) has been rectffied to match the high-resolution orbital picture given in Fig. 1.

Because of the lack of spectra in Gassendi, there is no way to refer to a standard area spectrally classified in terms of composition. As mentioned in the previous section, NA has been chosen on the basis of its high spectral homogeneity (~~r 3.3%), but its mineralogical composition is unknown. Consequently, the interpretation of observed spectral variations on the floor of Gassendi in terms of spectral absorption related to composition is not straightforward. However, an indirect piece of information relative to NA can be derived from the fact that the HR unit, which exhibits the highest spectral ratio within the image (8% to 10% above NA), lies within an extensive highland region identified by Pieters et a!. ( 1975). The spectrophotometry of such highland regions shows them in general to have a weak 1-jim absorption band (McCord et aL, 1972; Pieters et a!., 1980; Hawke et a!., 1989). On this basis, high O.97/O.56-jsm ratio areas correspond to highlands-rich material units, whereas low ratio areas are generally indicative of more mare-like material units. However, this simple trend may be obscured by soil maturity effects. The 0.97/0.56-jim ratio is sensitive to the abundance and type of mafic mineral present as well as the degree of maturity of the local soil; relatively low ratio values may be due to the freshness of the surface material, as in the case of fresh craters. As a consequence, the NA standard zone and the central peaks (except for P1 ), which spectrally respond the same and are ratio-depleted by 8% to 10% in respect to FIR, must have a somewhat 0.97-Mm-absorbing component. The NA area is about 7 km long X 7 km wide and has a relatively low albedo in both the visible and the near-infrared domains (Figs. 2 and 3). It is located northwest of the central peak complex, close to the junction of Rima Gassendi N and a major north-trending fracture in the western part of the floor (Figs. 4 and 5). It lies within a gentle depression bounded by a local 5000-rn elevation contour (see N4&4, 1971), tentatively interpreted as being due to endogenetic modification of the crater floor (Schultz, 1976b). Alternatively, as a result of important degradations undergone by old craters (Head, 1975), this area might consist of ejecta material from nearby craters such as Gassendi A or from a more distant event. Nevertheless, the fact that it has the same spectral ratio as the central peaks argues against this possibility. In strong contrast with the HR unit, the identification of areally restricted low albedo units (ST, STn, STs) displaying the lowest 0.97/0.56-jsm ratios (Fig. 4) and their association with morphological volcanic and tectonic features (Figs. 1 and 5) on the basis of photogeological evidences (Schultz, 1976a,b) call for the presence of a mafic component within these units. Although more information concerning the reflectance properties of these materials in the near-infrared spectral domain is needed for mineral identffication, this low ratio value may be indicative of a higher abundance of pyroxene such as is found for the mafic mare basalts (Adams, 1974; Pieters, 1986). In the study of Mare Humorum by Pieters et al. ( 1975), a part of the mare-like material, located on the floor of Gassendi and adjacent to the mare (see Li unit, Fig. 5), has been identified as being similar to the major basalt unit located in Mare Humorum. Pieters et a!. ( 1975) determined that this Mare Humorum unit is composed of a low titanium basalt (2% Ti02) with a major clinopyroxene mafic component. An important point is that the spectral units, Li, SI, STn, and STs, are located directly or in the vicinity of volcanic features such as domes, cones, and lava terraces. These photogeologically identffied (Schultz, 1976a,b) features suggest that extrusive activity occurred within the crater. Although the extensive mare-like material unit (Fig. 5) may be the result of partial lava flooding of Gassendi from Mare Humorum, it may also be a direct consequence of the extrusive volcanic activity, depending on its importance and its connection to the mare-related magma chamber through deepseated fractures. In addition, it is noteworthy that the crater Gassendi N, 4 km in diameter, is spectrally different from other equal-sized small craters such as Gassendi P and an unnamed crater located along the western rim of Gassendi (X; Figs. 4 and 5). These small fresh craters may be considered as near-subsurface probes (Piete~ 1977) that excavated material from a depth of a few hundred meters (Gault, 1973). These differences may be linked to their location within Gassendi. Whereas Gassendi P and X lie in the western part of the floor, Gassendi N is located between two fractures, Rima Gassendi I and III, on the mare-adjacent eastern side of Gassendi. The rather low spectral ratio GN unit (Fig. 5) may be due to the presence of mafic material with a significant pyroxene component, excavated from a shallow depth. Alternatively, the relatively low 0.97/ 0.56-nm value for GN could be due to the relative freshness of this crater. Radar backscatter measurements at 3.8 cm (Pieters et a]., 1975) are high for this crater, indicating a blocky or immature surface. Similarly, the low-ratio GA unit (Figs. 4 and 5) located within the 33-km-diameter Gassendi A crater may be mafic in composition. if so, as a direct consequence of the diameter difference (Settle and Head, 1979; P11w, 1980) between Gassendi A and Gassendi N, the GA unit material may have originated from a depth inferred to be an order of magnitude greater than in the case of Gassendi N. This low-ratio GA unit may also be due to the relative immaturity of the crater walls. The CF unit appears to be distributed about the perimeter of the crater interior (Fig. 5). This unit is spectrally intermediate between the NA and HR units and has a spectral ratio only 2% to 4% lower than HR It is thought to be composed of highlands-rich material. The interpretation of the spectral data, presented in this paper, suggests that the central part of Gassendi, inclusive of the central peak complex and those areas within the dotted lines of Fig. 5, may have a mafic pyroxene composition similar Chevrel and Pinet: Near-JR multispectral images for Gassendi 193 to the subsurface information derived from the Gassendi A spectral response. Furthermore, a concentration of very low O.97/O.56-~sm ratio units (ST, STn, STs, GN) located in the eastern side of the crater floor occurs in relation to several volcanic features and a dense interconnected tectonic pattern. While the western side of the crater is away from the edge of Mare Humorum, the eastern side may be directly above the pattern of fractures and thus may have experienced extrusive volcanic activity through scattered separated conduits, pipes, and fractures that lead to a partial inundation of the crater floor. This dichotomy, revealed by both photogeological (Fig. 1) and spectral (Figs. 4 and 5) observations, between the western and eastern (adjacent to mare) sides of the Ga.ssendi floor-fractured crater may be strongly rektted to the thermal history of Mare Humorum. Gassendi is classified as a class Ill crater (Schultz, 1976a) and presents a substantial floor uplift. Its stratigraphic age is Plc3 (WUheims and McCauley, 1971 ) or Nc (Cart 1984), corresponding to the terminal phase of Period I (Hea4 1975) (i.e., 3.95-3.85 by. old). The high rate of modification of craters in Period I (Pike, 1968) suggests that the residence time of a crater on the lunar surface during this period may be relatively short and that the vast majority of crater degradation takes place nearly coincident with its time of formation (Hea4 1975). Besides, the formation of Gassendi is contemporaneous with the formation and/or the early partial infilhing of Mare Humorum (Nb age; Carr, 1984) within a time interval on the order of 300 my. or less. Locally elevated temperatures may have occurred about the periphery of Humorum basin, as a result of heat remaining from the basin formation and/or the subsequent mare volcanism, and these higher temperatures may have lowered the effective ancient viscosity of the lunar interior. In this case, both the rapid temporal evolution of the crater topography and its preserved perennial shape may be explained simply by a viscous relaxation model using an elastic-viscous, two-layered substrate (P/net, 1985; Pl?Wt and Sour/au, 1989). With such a model the crater topography may have been modified within a relatively short time interval, on the order of 30-300 my., as a result of the substantial viscosity lowering of the lunar interior [to 1O22~1O23 P (P/net and Sour/au, 1989)]. Fractures of the crater floor may have been caused by stresses in excess of the elastic strength of the thin, brittle lithosphere. In this context the spectral clues of volcanic activity within Gassendi (very low O.97/O.56-/2m-ratio ST, STn, and STs units), which reinforce Schultz's (1976b) previous photogeological analysis, and possible the Li unit (Fig. 5), might well be indicative of the earliest infihling of Mare Humorum. A future valuable task should be to complete the nearinfrared spectral mapping of Gassendi, and, secondly, to map other craters around the edge of Mare Humorum in the same fashion. These craters include Doppelmayer, Vitello, Mersenius D, Mersenius G, and Liebig. These new maps will allow us to look at the spatial distribution of such low O.97/O.56-jsmspectral ratio patches in relation with the main concentric scarps and faults of Mare Humorum. The acquisition of additional spectral bands within the O.9-1.05-jsm domain should help distinguish a larger variety of surface units in this region of the Moon. Acknowledgments.

Both a very recent impact on the Moon and fluid turbulence in the lunar core are plausible mechanisms for generating these free librations.","author_facet_hier":["0/Yoder, C","1/Yoder, C/Yoder, C F"],"bibcode":"1981RSPTA.303..327Y","bibgroup":["LPI"],"bibgroup_facet":["LPI"],"bibstem":["RSPTA","RSPTA.303"],"bibstem_facet":"RSPTA","cite_read_boost":0.41653436,"citation_count":50,"citation":["1982Icar...49..327Y","1983Natur.301..225S","1983RvGSP..21..569T","1984EOSTr..65..369N","1984Natur.307..662R","1985Icar...64..391R","1986JGR....91..447R","1986JGR....91..453T","1987Natur.325..133R","1989AstQ....6....5C","1989Icar...78...90R","1993CeMDA..57..307E","1994AdSpR..14..233B","1994RSPTA.349..181R","1994Sci...265..482D","1995A&A...296..850B","1995A&A...300..559B","1995Icar..117..250Y","1995JGR...10026297B","1996A&A...314..989B","1996CeMDA..66...21N","1996EM&P...73..259J","1996IAUS..172...37N","1996LPI....27.1439W","1996PhRvD..53.6730W","1997AdSpR..19.1511K","1999ARA&A..37..533P","2000JGR...10529277B","2000LPI....31.2018W","2001CeMDA..80..215N","2001JGR...10627933W","2001LPI....32.1007W","2001LPI....32.2028W","2001M&PS...36..525W","2003JGRE..108.5100C","2006AdSpR..37...72B","2007LPI....38.2199P","2008AdSpR..42..289G","2008AdSpR..42.1378K","2008LPI....39.1769R","2008LPI....39.1849R","2010SSRv..152..449B","2011CeMDA.109...85R","2011Icar..214..779C","2011LPI....42.1151B","2011Natur.479..212D","2011Natur.479..215L","2012JGRE..117.0L09M","2012P&SS...74...15J","2012SCPMA..55..723H"],"comment":"ADS","database":["ASTRONOMY","GENERAL"],"date":"1981-12-01T00:00:00Z","doi":["10.1098/rsta.1981.0206"],"first_author_facet_hier":["0/Yoder, C","1/Yoder, C/Yoder, C F"],"id":"2422291","recid":2422291,"identifier":["1981RSPTA.303..327Y","1981RSLPT.303..327Y"],"alternate_bibcode":["1981RSLPT.303..327Y"],"ids_data":["{\"identifier\":\"1981RSPTA.303..327Y\", \"alternate_bibcode\":\"\", \"deleted_bibcode\":\"\", \"description\":\"ADS bibcode\"}","{\"identifier\":\"\", \"alternate_bibcode\":\"1981RSLPT.303..327Y\", \"deleted_bibcode\":\"\", \"description\":\"alternate\"}"],"issue":"1477","keyword":["MOON","LIBRATIONS","AXIS","ROTATION","TIDAL EFFECTS","FRICTION","CALCULATIONS","LASER METHODS","CORES","FLUID","DIAGRAMS","MANTLE","HYPOTHESES","VISCOSITY","TURBULENCE","KINEMATICS","SIZE","PARAMETERS","AMPLITUDE","solar system general","rotation","hydrodynamics","methods miscellaneous","cores","diagrams","theory","hydrodynamics","turbulence","kinematics and dynamics","size","parametrization","amplitude","Librational Motion","Lunar Rotation","Moon","Precession","Spin Dynamics","Ecliptic","Kinetic Friction","Laser Range Finders","Lunar Orbits","Turbulent Flow","Viscous Fluids","Lunar and Planetary Exploration; Moon","MOON","LIBRATIONS","AXIS","ROTATION","TIDAL EFFECTS","FRICTION","CALCULATIONS","LASER METHODS","CORES","FLUID","DIAGRAMS","MANTLE","HYPOTHESES","VISCOSITY","TURBULENCE","KINEMATICS","SIZE","PARAMETERS","AMPLITUDE","LIBRATIONAL MOTION","LUNAR ROTATION","MOON","PRECESSION","SPIN DYNAMICS","ECLIPTIC","KINETIC FRICTION","LASER RANGE FINDERS","LUNAR ORBITS","TURBULENT FLOW","VISCOUS FLUIDS"],"keyword_facet":["solar system general","precession","quantum theory","ecliptic","kinematics and dynamics","turbulence","hydrodynamics","solar system general","rotation","hydrodynamics","methods miscellaneous","cores","diagrams","theory","hydrodynamics","turbulence","kinematics and dynamics","size","parametrization","amplitude","solar system general","precession","quantum theory","ecliptic","kinematics and dynamics","turbulence","hydrodynamics"],"keyword_norm":["Librational Motion","Lunar Rotation","Moon","Precession","Spin Dynamics","Ecliptic","Kinetic Friction","Laser Range Finders","Lunar Orbits","Turbulent Flow","Viscous Fluids","Lunar and Planetary Exploration; Moon","MOON","LIBRATIONS","AXIS","ROTATION","TIDAL EFFECTS","FRICTION","CALCULATIONS","LASER METHODS","CORES","FLUID","DIAGRAMS","MANTLE","HYPOTHESES","VISCOSITY","TURBULENCE","KINEMATICS","SIZE","PARAMETERS","AMPLITUDE","LIBRATIONAL MOTION","LUNAR ROTATION","MOON","PRECESSION","SPIN DYNAMICS","ECLIPTIC","KINETIC FRICTION","LASER RANGE FINDERS","LUNAR ORBITS","TURBULENT FLOW","VISCOUS FLUIDS"],"keyword_schema":["NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","STI category","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","LPI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI","NASA/STI"],"links_data":["{\"title\":\"\", \"type\":\"electr\", \"instances\":\"\"}","{\"title\":\"\", \"type\":\"ADSlink\", \"instances\":\"\"}"],"classic_factor":8538,"page":["327-338"],"property":["REFEREED","ARTICLE"],"pub":"Royal Society of London Philosophical Transactions Series A","pub_raw":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Triangular plots of source rock components [defined as anorthosites, crystalline (melt) matrix breccias, and metamorphosed breccias] show that, with the possible exception of soils 64501 and 68501, Apollo 16 soils have similar source rocks that are well homogenized throughout the site. Modal abundance variations in submillimeter size fractions tend to reflect those of rake and rock samples. Maturity plots in agglutinate-monomineralic fragment-lithic and crystalline breccia space show Apollo 16 soils to be generally mature except for those collected from trenches (61221 and 61241) and from locations near North Ray Crater (stations 11 and 13). Data produced by other workers is combined with data from this study and used to divide the Apollo 16 site into three soil petrographic provinces. Central site soils are mature, well homogenized, and enriched in glass, but patches of immature and/or inhomogenous material are also present. They are probably the most typical Cayley Plains materials present at the site. North Ray soils are immature to submature, containing North Ray ejecta in the form of feldspathic fragmental breccia and plagioclase. South Ray soils are mature, but contain small amounts of fresh impact melts and plagioclase, possibly from breakdown of blocky South Ray ejecta. South Ray and North Ray ejecta differ in composition and physical properties, supporting the hypothesis that the South Ray event excavated Cayley material while the North Ray event excavated Descartes material.","author_facet_hier":["0/Houck, K","1/Houck, K/Houck, Karen J"],"bibcode":"1982LPSC...13..197H","bibgroup":["LPI"],"bibgroup_facet":["LPI"],"bibstem":["LPSC","LPSC...13"],"bibstem_facet":"LPSC","cite_read_boost":0.2528,"citation_count":7,"citation":["1982LPSC...13..210H","1986LPI....17..394J","1996JGR...101.2225F","1997Icar..130..125S","1997M&PS...32..447K","2001M&PS...36...31N","2006GeCoA..70.6050Z"],"copyright":"(c) 1982: American Geophysical Union","database":["ASTRONOMY","PHYSICS"],"date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00Z","doi":["10.1029/JB087iS01p0A197"],"first_author_facet_hier":["0/Houck, K","1/Houck, K/Houck, Karen J"],"body":" References Adams, J.

Modal data show that the Cone Crater soil is immature, whereas the ‘smooth plains’ soils are mature and rich in agglutinates and breccias. Neither core exhibits any major variations with depth. Microprobe analyses of mineral and glass fragments are consistent with derivation of the soils predominantly from the local rocks, with ̃5-11% exotic mare component indicated by the modal data. About 4% of the glasses are SiO<SUB>2</SUB>- and K<SUB>2</SUB>O-rich granitic glasses which are comminuted mesostasis from the local melt rocks. The soils are depleted in feldspar relative to the source rocks.

Specifically, it is enriched in Al, Ca, Na, K, light rare earth elements, and Th, and depleted in Mg, Fe, Mn, and Sc. Three models have been proposed to explain those systematics. The Exotic Component model holds that a fine-grained, KREEPy exotic component was distributed on a global scale, perhaps by the Imbrian impact. In the Simple Comminution model, the <10 μm chemical systematics are due to differential comminution processes with fine-grained melt-rock mesostasis and feldspar concentrating in this fraction. The Soil Mixing model states that the chemical systematics are due to mixing of compositionally distinct soils that have different grain-size distributions. To determine which model is correct, modal petrographic data were obtained by scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X ray analysis for the <10 μm fractions of four Apollo soils: 10084, 14163, 15271, and 64501. Modal results are consistent with chemical data regarding feldspathic and KREEP enrichments in the finest fraction. Soil glass contents, crystalline silica, and plagioclase/mafic mineral ratios are greater in the <10 μm fraction than in the coarser fractions for all soils. Grain-size distributions are inconsistent with a fine-grained exotic component derived from distant sources. Comminution of local lithologies, vertical mixing, and local lateral transport control the <10 μm soil composition.","author_facet_hier":["0/Devine, J","1/Devine, J/Devine, James M","0/McKay, D","1/McKay, D/McKay, David S","0/Papike, J","1/Papike, J/Papike, James J"],"bibcode":"1982LPSC...13..260D","bibgroup":["LPI"],"bibgroup_facet":["LPI"],"bibstem":["LPSC","LPSC...13"],"bibstem_facet":"LPSC","cite_read_boost":0.2235,"citation_count":5,"citation":["1982LPSC...13..232S","1989GeCoA..53.3061K","1989GeCoA..53.3067L","1992JGR....97..947C","2011Icar..214...53N"],"copyright":"(c) 1982: American Geophysical Union","database":["ASTRONOMY","PHYSICS"],"date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00Z","doi":["10.1029/JB087iS01p0A260"],"first_author_facet_hier":["0/Devine, J","1/Devine, J/Devine, James M"],"body":" References Arvidson, R., R.

A workshop to explore an in situ open ocean mesoscale CO2 perturbation experiment that would simulate the oceanic conditions expected toward the end of this century was held at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University (LDEO). The objectives were to evaluate the current understanding of the potential effects on open ocean ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling resulting from carbon chemistry and pH changes in response to increased atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and to examine the scientific justification and logistical feasibility of an in situ open ocean mesoscale CO2/pH perturbation experiment.
